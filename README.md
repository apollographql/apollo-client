### Local development

```
# nvm use node
npm install
npm test
```

This project uses TypeScript for static typing and TSLint for linting. You can get both of these built into your editor with no configuration by opening this project in [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/), an open source IDE which is available for free on all platforms.

### Useful tools

Should be moved into some kind of CONTRIBUTING.md soon...

- [AST explorer](https://astexplorer.net/): you can use this to see what the GraphQL query AST looks like for different queries

###### `queryRef`

`QueryRef<TData>`
</td>
<td>

In order to link a query initiated by a specific `useBackgroundQuery` call to the place its data is consumed—which can be uniquely identified not only by the query and variables passed, but also the optional `queryKey` supplied by the user—the hook returns a `queryRef` that can later be read by `useReadQuery`.

**Helper functions**

</td>

<tr>
<td>

###### `refetch`

`(variables?: Partial<TVariables>) => Promise<ApolloQueryResult>`
</td>

<td>

A function that enables you to re-execute the query, optionally passing in new `variables`.

To guarantee that the refetch performs a network request, its `fetchPolicy` is set to `network-only` (unless the original query's `fetchPolicy` is `no-cache` or `cache-and-network`, which also guarantee a network request).

Calling this function will cause the component to re-suspend, unless the call site is wrapped in [`startTransition`](https://react.dev/reference/react/startTransition).

</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>

###### `fetchMore`

`({ query?: DocumentNode, variables?: TVariables, updateQuery: Function}) => Promise<ApolloQueryResult>`
</td>

<td>

A function that helps you fetch the next set of results for a [paginated list field](/react/pagination/core-api/).

Calling this function will cause the component to re-suspend, unless the call site is wrapped in [`startTransition`](https://react.dev/reference/react/startTransition).

/** @jest-environment node */
// We run this in a node environment because:
// A) JSDOM doesn't yet support the TextEncoder/TextDecoder globals added in node 11, meaning certain imports (e.g. reactSSR) will fail (See https://github.com/jsdom/jsdom/issues/2524)
// B) We're just testing imports/exports, so no reason not to use Node for slightly better performance.

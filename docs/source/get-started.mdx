Hello! ðŸ‘‹ This short tutorial gets you up and running with Apollo Client.

> For an introduction to the entire Apollo platform, [check out **Odyssey**, Apollo's interactive learning platform](https://www.apollographql.com/tutorials/?utm_source=apollo_docs&utm_medium=referral).

## Step 1: Setup

To start this tutorial, do one of the following:

- Create a new React project locally with [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/), or
- Create a new React sandbox on [CodeSandbox](https://codesandbox.io/).

## Step 2: Install dependencies

Applications that use Apollo Client require the following top-level dependencies:

- `@apollo/client`: This single package contains virtually everything you need to set up Apollo Client. It includes the in-memory cache, local state management, error handling, and a React-based view layer.
- `graphql`: This package provides logic for parsing GraphQL queries.
- `rxjs`: This package provides the `Observable` primitive used throughout Apollo Client.

Run the following command to install both of these packages:

```bash
npm install @apollo/client graphql rxjs
```

Our example application will use the [FlyBy GraphQL API](https://flyby-router-demo.herokuapp.com/) from Apollo Odyssey's [Voyage tutorial series](https://www.apollographql.com/tutorials/voyage-part1/). This API provides a list of intergalactic travel locations and details about those locations ðŸ‘½

## Step 3: Initialize `ApolloClient`

With our dependencies set up, we can now initialize an `ApolloClient` instance.

In `main.jsx`, let's first import the symbols we need from `@apollo/client` and `@apollo/client/react`:

```jsx title="main.jsx"
import { ApolloClient, HttpLink, InMemoryCache, gql } from "@apollo/client";
import { ApolloProvider } from "@apollo/client/react";
```

Next we'll initialize `ApolloClient`, passing its constructor a configuration object with the `link` and `cache` fields:

```jsx title="main.jsx"
const client = new ApolloClient({
  link: new HttpLink({ uri: "https://flyby-router-demo.herokuapp.com/" }),
  cache: new InMemoryCache(),
});
```

- `link` specifies the [Apollo Link](./api/link/introduction/) that will be used to execute GraphQL operations against the network. We give it an instance of [`HttpLink`](./api/link/apollo-link-http) - a customized Apollo Link that knows how to execute network requests against a GraphQL server.
- `cache` is an instance of `InMemoryCache`, which Apollo Client uses to cache query results after fetching them.

That's it! Our `client` is ready to start fetching data. Now before we start using Apollo Client with React, let's first try sending a query with plain JavaScript.

In the same `main.jsx` file, call `client.query()` with the query string (wrapped in the `gql` template literal) shown below:

```jsx title="main.jsx"
// const client = ...

client
  .query({
    query: gql`
      query GetLocations {
        locations {
          id
          name
          description
          photo
        }
      }
    `,
  })
  .then((result) => console.log(result));
```

Run this code, open your console, and inspect the result object. You should see a `data` property with `locations` attached. Nice!

Although executing GraphQL operations directly like this can be useful, Apollo Client really shines when it's integrated with a view layer like React. You can bind queries to your UI and update it automatically as new data is fetched.

Let's look at how that works!

## Step 4: Connect your client to React

You connect Apollo Client to React with the [`ApolloProvider`](./api/react/ApolloProvider/) component. Similar to React's [`Context.Provider`](https://react.dev/reference/react/useContext), `ApolloProvider` wraps your React app and places Apollo Client on the context, enabling you to access it from anywhere in your component tree.

In `main.jsx`, let's wrap our React app with an `ApolloProvider`. We suggest putting the `ApolloProvider` near the root of your application, above any component that might need to access GraphQL data.

```jsx title="main.jsx" {16-18}
import React from "react";
import * as ReactDOM from "react-dom/client";
import { ApolloClient, InMemoryCache } from "@apollo/client";
import { ApolloProvider } from "@apollo/client/react";
import App from "./App";

const client = new ApolloClient({
  uri: "https://flyby-router-demo.herokuapp.com/",
  cache: new InMemoryCache(),
});

// Supported in React 18+
const root = ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById("root"));

root.render(
  <ApolloProvider client={client}>
    <App />
  </ApolloProvider>
);
```

## Step 5: Fetch data with `useQuery`

After your `ApolloProvider` is hooked up, you can start requesting data with [`useQuery`](./api/react/useQuery/). The `useQuery` hook is a [React hook](https://react.dev/reference/react) that shares GraphQL data with your UI.

Switching over to our `App.jsx` file, we'll start by replacing our existing file contents with the code snippet below:

```jsx title="App.jsx"
// Import everything needed to use the `useQuery` hook
import { gql } from "@apollo/client";
import { useQuery } from "@apollo/client/react";

export default function App() {
  return (
    <div>
      <h2>My first Apollo app ðŸš€</h2>
    </div>
  );
}
```

We can define the query we want to execute by wrapping it in the `gql` template literal:

```jsx title="App.jsx"
const GET_LOCATIONS = gql`
  query GetLocations {
    locations {
      id
      name
      description
      photo
    }
  }
`;
```

Next, let's define a component named `DisplayLocations` that executes our `GET_LOCATIONS` query with the `useQuery` hook:

```jsx title="App.jsx" {2}
function DisplayLocations() {
  const { loading, error, data } = useQuery(GET_LOCATIONS);

  if (loading) return <p>Loading...</p>;
  if (error) return <p>Error : {error.message}</p>;

  return data.locations.map(({ id, name, description, photo }) => (
    <div key={id}>
      <h3>{name}</h3>
      <img width="400" height="250" alt="location-reference" src={`${photo}`} />
      <br />
      <b>About this location:</b>
      <p>{description}</p>
      <br />
    </div>
  ));
}
```

Whenever this component renders, the `useQuery` hook automatically executes our query and returns a result object containing `loading`, `error`, `data`, and `dataState` properties:

- Apollo Client automatically tracks a query's loading and error states, which are reflected in the `loading` and `error` properties.
- When the result of your query comes back, it's attached to the `data` property.

Finally, we'll add `DisplayLocations` to our existing component tree:

```jsx title="App.jsx" {6}
export default function App() {
  return (
    <div>
      <h2>My first Apollo app ðŸš€</h2>
      <br />
      <DisplayLocations />
    </div>
  );
}
```

When your app reloads, you should briefly see a loading indicator, followed by a list of locations and details about those locations! If you don't, you can compare your code against the [completed app on CodeSandbox](https://codesandbox.io/s/github/apollographql/docs-examples/tree/main/apollo-client/v3/getting-started).

Congrats, you just made your first component that renders with GraphQL data from Apollo Client! ðŸŽ‰ Now you can try building more components that use `useQuery` and experiment with the concepts you just learned.

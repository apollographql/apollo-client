// For watched queries, the transformer is only called when the data retrieved from the server is
// different from previous.
//
// If the transformer wants to mutate results (say, by setting the prototype of result data), it
// will likely need to be paired with a custom resultComparator.  By default, Apollo performs a
// deep equality comparsion on results, and skips those that are considered equal - reducing
// re-renders.

**Last updated: 2023-05-30**

For up to date release notes, refer to the project's [Changelog](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-client/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md).

> **Please note:** This is an approximation of **larger effort** work planned for the next 6 - 12 months. It does not cover all new functionality that will be added, and nothing here is set in stone. Also note that each of these releases, and several patch releases in-between, will include bug fixes (based on issue triaging) and community submitted PRs.

## ‚úã Community feedback & prioritization

- Please report feature requests or bugs as a new [issue](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-client/issues/new/choose).
- If you already see an issue that interests you please add a üëç or a comment so we can measure community interest.

## [3.8.0](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-client/milestone/30)

_Approximate Date: GA TBD after user feedback_

Currently in active development and in the beta stage.  React 18 users will get a lot out of this release since it introduces support for Suspense.  There are also new features added to the core as well.  Here's a brief overview:

- Add a new hook `useSuspenseQuery` which will provide the core functionality for React 18 `Suspense` capabilities
- Ability to use `Suspense` with `@defer`
- Introduce new hooks `useBackgroundQuery` and `useReadQuery` with `Suspense` support
- Support custom GraphQL document transforms
- Improved error messaging and bundling
- Stable `useFragment` implementation
- New client-side `@nonreactive` directive
- A new optional `removeTypenameFromVariables` Apollo Link that will automatically strip `__typename` from your variables for each request

Try it today: `npm i @apollo/client@beta` and let us know what you think!

## Future 3.x releases

_Approximate Date: TBD_

The 3.8 release is a major milestone for the project's React support.  Feedback from the community will have a big impact on where we go next, particularly as use cases for React Server Components and other React 18 features emerge.  In addition to new functionality, there is a significant backlog of questions and fixes that we want to categorize and thoughtfully address in upcoming releases.

## 4.0

- `Release 4.0` will be our next major release of the Client and is still in early planning.  See Github [4.0 Milestone](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-client/milestone/31) for more details.

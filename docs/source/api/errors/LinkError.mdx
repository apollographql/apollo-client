{/* * @import {MDXProvidedComponents} from '../../../shared/MdxProvidedComponents.js' */}

A facade error type that keeps a registry of errors emitted from the link chain. `LinkError` is not an error class itself but rather a utility to detect whether an error originated from the link chain.

This can be useful in cases where an Apollo Client API is wrapped by your own custom handling, which may throw its own errors, and you want to retry an operation at the call site when the error originates from the link chain.

The following example creates a custom wrapped query function that detects whether the query includes an operation name and throws if not.

```ts
import { LinkError } from "@apollo/client/errors";

async function runQuery<TData>(query: TypedDocumentNode<TData>) {
  if (!hasOperationName(query)) {
    throw new Error("Queries should have operation names.")
  }

  return client.watchQuery({ query })
}

try {
  const result = await runQuery(query);
} catch (error) {
  // Only log the error if the error wasn't our own custom thrown error
  if (LinkError.is(error)) {
    console.log('Got network error:', error.message)
  }
}
```

Here `LinkError` is used to detect whether the caught `error` originated from the link chain to detect whether the error was the custom error thrown by `runQuery`. Without `LinkError`, it would be difficult to distinguish the error objects apart without more complex code, such as a custom error class.

## Static methods

### `is`

A function guard that determines whether an error originated from the link chain. `is` does not provide any type narrowing.

```ts
if (Link.is(error)) {
  // The error originated from the link chain
  console.log('Got network error:', error.message);
}
```

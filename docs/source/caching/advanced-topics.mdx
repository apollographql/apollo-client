title: Advanced topics on caching in Apollo Client

This article describes special cases and considerations when using the Apollo Client cache.

## Bypassing the cache

Sometimes you _shouldn't_ use the cache for a particular GraphQL operation. For example, a query's response might be a token that's only used once. In cases like this, use [the `no-cache` fetch policy](../data/queries/#setting-a-fetch-policy):

```js
const { loading, error, data } = useQuery(GET_DOGS, {
  fetchPolicy: "no-cache" // highlight-line
});
```

Operations that use this fetch policy don't write their result to the cache, and they also don't check the cache for data before sending a request to your server. [See all available fetch policies.](../data/queries/#setting-a-fetch-policy)

## Persisting the cache

You can persist and rehydrate the `InMemoryCache` from a storage provider like `AsyncStorage` or `localStorage`. To do so, use the [`apollo3-cache-persist`](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-cache-persist) library. This library works with a variety of [storage providers](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-cache-persist#storage-providers).

To get started, pass your cache and a storage provider to `persistCache`. By default, the contents of your cache are immediately restored asynchronously, and they're persisted on every write to the cache with a short configurable debounce interval.

> Note: The `persistCache` method is async and returns a `Promise`.

```js
import { AsyncStorage } from 'react-native';
import { InMemoryCache } from '@apollo/client';
import { persistCache } from 'apollo3-cache-persist';

const cache = new InMemoryCache();

persistCache({
  cache,
  storage: AsyncStorage,
}).then(() => {
  // Continue setting up Apollo Client as usual.
})
```

For advanced usage and additional configuration options, see the [README of `apollo3-cache-persist`](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-cache-persist).

## Resetting the cache

Sometimes, you might want to reset the cache entirely, such as [when a user logs out](../networking/authentication/#reset-store-on-logout). To accomplish this, call `client.resetStore`. This method is asynchronous, because it also refetches any of your active queries.

```js
export default withApollo(graphql(PROFILE_QUERY, {
  props: ({ data: { loading, currentUser }, ownProps: { client }}) => ({
    loading,
    currentUser,
    resetOnLogout: async () => client.resetStore(),
  }),
})(Profile));
```

> To reset the cache _without_ refetching active queries, use `client.clearStore()` instead of `client.resetStore()`.

### Responding to cache resets

You can register callback functions that execute whenever `client.resetStore` is called. To do so, call `client.onResetStore` and pass in your callback. To register multiple callbacks, call `client.onResetStore` multiple times. All of your callbacks are added to an array and are executed concurrently whenever the cache is reset.

In this example, we use `client.onResetStore` to write default values to the cache. This is useful when using Apollo Client's [local state management](../local-state/local-state-management/) features and calling `client.resetStore` anywhere in your application.

```js
import { ApolloClient, InMemoryCache } from '@apollo/client';
import { withClientState } from 'apollo-link-state';

import { resolvers, defaults } from './resolvers';

const cache = new InMemoryCache();
const stateLink = withClientState({ cache, resolvers, defaults });

const client = new ApolloClient({
  cache,
  link: stateLink,
});

client.onResetStore(stateLink.writeDefaults);
```

You can also call `client.onResetStore` from your React components. This can be useful if you want to force your UI to rerender after the cache is reset.

The `client.onResetStore` method's return value is a function you can call to unregister your callback:

```js {6-8,12}
import { withApollo } from "@apollo/react-hoc";

export class Foo extends Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);
    this.unsubscribe = props.client.onResetStore(
      () => this.setState({ reset: false })
    );
    this.state = { reset: false };
  }
  componentDidUnmount() {
    this.unsubscribe();
  }
  render() {
    return this.state.reset ? <div /> : <span />
  }
}

export default withApollo(Foo);
```

## Refetching queries after a mutation

In certain cases, writing an `update` function to [update the cache after a mutation](../data/mutations/#updating-local-data) can be complex, or even impossible if the mutation doesn't return modified fields.

In these cases, you can provide a `refetchQueries` option to the `useMutation` hook to automatically rerun certain queries after the mutation completes.

For details, see [Refetching queries](../data/mutations/#refetching-queries).

> Note that although `refetchQueries` can be faster to implement than an `update` function, it also requires additional network requests that are usually undesirable. For more information, see [this blog post](https://www.apollographql.com/blog/when-to-use-refetch-queries-in-apollo-client/).

## Cache redirects

In some cases, a query requests data that already exists in the cache under a different reference. For example, your UI might have a list view and a detail view that both use the same data.

The list view might run the following query:

```graphql
query Books {
  books {
    id
    title
    abstract
  }
}
```

When a specific book is selected, the detail view might display an individual item using this query:

```graphql
query Book($id: ID!) {
  book(id: $id) {
    id
    title
    abstract
  }
}
```

In a case like this, _we_ know that the second query's data might already be in the cache, but because that data was fetched by a different query, _Apollo Client_ doesn't know that. To tell Apollo Client where to look for the cached `Book` object, we can define a field policy `read` function for the `book` field:

```js {9-14}
import { ApolloClient, InMemoryCache } from '@apollo/client';

const client = new ApolloClient({
  cache: new InMemoryCache({
    typePolicies: {
      Query: {
        fields: {
          book: {
            read(_, { args, toReference }) {
              return toReference({
                __typename: 'Book',
                id: args.id,
              });
            }
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
});
```

This `read` function uses the `toReference` helper utility to generate and return a **cache reference** for a `Book` object, based on its `__typename` and `id`.

Now whenever a query includes the `book` field, the `read` function above executes and returns a reference to a `Book` object. Apollo Client uses this reference to look up the object in its cache and return it if it's present. If it _isn't_ present, Apollo Client knows it needs to execute the query over the network.

> ⚠️ **Note:** To avoid a network request, _all_ of a query's requested fields must already be present in the cache. If the detail view's query fetches _any_ `Book` field that the list view's query _didn't_, Apollo Client considers the cache hit to be incomplete, and it executes the full query over the network.

## Pagination utilities

### Incremental loading: `fetchMore`

You can use the `fetchMore` function to update a query's cached result with data returned by a _followup_ query. Most often, `fetchMore` is used to handle infinite-scroll pagination and other situations where you're loading _more_ data when you already have _some_.

For details, see [The `fetchMore` function](../pagination/core-api/#the-fetchmore-function).

### The `@connection` directive

Fundamentally, paginated queries are the same as any other query with the exception that calls to `fetchMore` update the same cache key. Since these queries are cached by both the initial query and their parameters, a problem arises when later retrieving or updating paginated queries in the cache. We don’t care about pagination arguments such as limits, offsets, or cursors outside of the need to `fetchMore`, nor do we want to provide them simply for accessing cached data.

To solve this Apollo Client 1.6 introduced the `@connection` directive to specify a custom store key for results. A connection allows us to set the cache key for a field and to filter which arguments actually alter the query.

To use the `@connection` directive, simply add the directive to the segment of the query you want a custom store key for and provide the `key` parameter to specify the store key. In addition to the `key` parameter, you can also include the optional `filter` parameter, which takes an array of query argument names to include in the generated custom store key.

```js
const query = gql`
  query Feed($type: FeedType!, $offset: Int, $limit: Int) {
    feed(type: $type, offset: $offset, limit: $limit) @connection(key: "feed", filter: ["type"]) {
      ...FeedEntry
    }
  }
`
```

With the above query, even with multiple `fetchMore`s, the results of each feed update will always result in the `feed` key in the store being updated with the latest accumulated values. In this example, we also use the `@connection` directive's optional `filter` argument to include the `type` query argument in the store key, which results in multiple store values that accumulate queries from each type of feed.

Now that we have a stable store key, we can easily use `writeQuery` to perform a store update, in this case clearing out the feed.

```js
client.writeQuery({
  query: gql`
    query Feed($type: FeedType!) {
      feed(type: $type) @connection(key: "feed", filter: ["type"]) {
        id
      }
    }
  `,
  variables: {
    type: "top",
  },
  data: {
    feed: [],
  },
});
```

Note that because we are only using the `type` argument in the store key, we don't have to provide `offset` or `limit`.

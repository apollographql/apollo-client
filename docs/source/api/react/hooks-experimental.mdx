## `useFragment_experimental`

### Installation

> ⚠️ **The `useFragment_experimental` hook is currently at the [preview stage](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/resources/release-stages/#preview) in Apollo Client and is available by installing `@apollo/client@beta`.** If you have feedback on it, please let us know via [GitHub issues](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-client/issues/new?assignees=&labels=&template=bug.md).

Beginning with version `3.7.0`, Apollo Client Web has preview support for the `useFragment_experimental` hook, which represents a lightweight live binding into the Apollo Client Cache. This hook returns an always-up-to-date view of whatever data the cache currently contains for a given fragment. `useFragment_experimental` never triggers network requests of its own.

`useFragment_experimental` enables Apollo Client to broadcast very specific fragment results to individual components. Note that the `useQuery` hook remains the primary hook responsible for querying and populating data in the cache ([see the API reference](./hooks#usequery)). As a result, the component reading the fragment data via `useFragment_experimental` is still subscribed to all changes in the query data, but receives updates only when that fragment's specific data change.

### Using `useFragment_experimental`

> A [GraphQL fragment](http://graphql.org/learn/queries/#fragments) is a piece of logic that can be shared between multiple queries and mutations. [See the API reference.](../../data/fragments)

Given the following fragment definition:

```js
const ItemFragment = gql`
  fragment ItemFragment on Item {
    text
  }
`;
```

We can first use the `useQuery` hook to retrieve a list of items with `id`s.

```jsx
const listQuery = gql`
  query {
    list {
      id
    }
  }
`;
function List() {
  const { loading, data } = useQuery(listQuery);
  return (
    <ol>
      {data?.list.map(item => <Item key={item.id} id={item.id}/>)}
    </ol>
  );
}
```

We can then use `useFragment_experimental` from within the `<Item>` component to create a live binding for each item by providing the `fragment` document, `fragmentName` and object reference via `from`.

```jsx
function Item(props: { id: number }) {
  const { complete, data } = useFragment_experimental({
    fragment: ItemFragment,
    fragmentName: "ItemFragment",
    from: {
      __typename: "Item",
      id: props.id,
    },
  });
  return <li>{complete ? data!.text : "incomplete"}</li>;
}
```

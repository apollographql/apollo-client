This article shows how to fetch GraphQL data in React with the `useQuery` hook and attach the result to your UI. You'll also learn how Apollo Client simplifies data management code by tracking error and loading states for you.

## Prerequisites

This article assumes you're familiar with building basic GraphQL queries. If you need a refresher, we recommend [this guide](http://graphql.org/learn/queries/). You can also build example queries against Apollo's [full-stack tutorial server](https://apollo-fullstack-tutorial.herokuapp.com/graphql).

This article also assumes that you've already set up Apollo Client and have wrapped your React app in an `ApolloProvider` component. For more information, see the [getting started guide](../get-started/).

> To follow along with the examples below, open up our [starter project](https://codesandbox.io/s/queries-example-app-start-nvp9z) and [sample GraphQL server](https://codesandbox.io/s/queries-example-app-server-71z1g) on CodeSandbox. You can view the completed version of the app [here](https://codesandbox.io/s/queries-example-app-final-nrlnl).

## Executing a query

The `useQuery` [React hook](https://react.dev/reference/react) is the primary API for executing queries in an Apollo application. To run a query within a React component, call `useQuery` and pass it a GraphQL query string. When your component renders, `useQuery` returns an object from Apollo Client that contains `loading`, `error`, and `data` properties you can use to render your UI.

> **Note:** in Apollo Client >= 3.8, Suspense data fetching hooks are available for querying data within `<Suspense />` boundaries using React 18's new concurrent rendering model. For more information see Apollo Client's [Suspense docs](./suspense/).

Let's look at an example. First, we'll create a GraphQL query named `GET_DOGS`. Remember to wrap query strings in the `gql` function to parse them into query documents:

```js title="index.js"
import { gql, useQuery } from '@apollo/client';

const GET_DOGS = gql`
  query GetDogs {
    dogs {
      id
      breed
    }
  }
`;
```

Next, we'll create a component named `Dogs`. Inside it, we'll pass our `GET_DOGS` query to the `useQuery` hook:

```jsx title="index.js"
function Dogs({ onDogSelected }) {
  const { loading, error, data } = useQuery(GET_DOGS);

  if (loading) return 'Loading...';
  if (error) return `Error! ${error.message}`;

  return (
    <select name='dog' onChange={onDogSelected}>
      {data.dogs.map((dog) => (
        <option key={dog.id} value={dog.breed}>
          {dog.breed}
        </option>
      ))}
    </select>
  );
}
```

As our query executes and the values of `loading`, `error`, and `data` change, the `Dogs` component can intelligently render different UI elements according to the query's state:

- As long as `loading` is `true` (indicating the query is still in flight), the component presents a `Loading...` notice.
- When loading is `false` and there is no `error`, the query has completed. The component renders a dropdown menu that's populated with the list of dog breeds returned by the server.

When the user selects a dog breed from the populated dropdown, the selection is sent to the parent component via the provided `onDogSelected` function.

In the next step, we'll associate the dropdown with a more sophisticated query that uses GraphQL variables.

## Caching query results

Whenever Apollo Client fetches query results from your server, it automatically **caches** those results locally. This makes later executions of that same query extremely fast.

To see this caching in action, let's build a new component called `DogPhoto`. `DogPhoto` accepts a prop called `breed` that reflects the current value of the dropdown menu in our `Dogs` component:

```jsx title="index.js"
const GET_DOG_PHOTO = gql`
  query Dog($breed: String!) {
    dog(breed: $breed) {
      id
      displayImage
    }
  }
`;

function DogPhoto({ breed }) {
  const { loading, error, data } = useQuery(GET_DOG_PHOTO, {
    variables: { breed },
  });

  if (loading) return null;
  if (error) return `Error! ${error}`;

  return (
    <img src={data.dog.displayImage} style={{ height: 100, width: 100 }} />
  );
}
```

Notice that we're providing a configuration option (`variables`) to the `useQuery` hook this time. The `variables` option is an object that contains all of the variables we want to pass to our GraphQL query. In this case, we want to pass the currently selected `breed` from the dropdown.

Select `bulldog` from the dropdown to see its photo appear. Then switch to another breed, and then switch _back_ to `bulldog`. You'll notice that the bulldog photo loads instantly the second time around. This is the cache at work!

Next, let's learn some techniques for ensuring that our cached data is fresh.

## Updating cached query results

Sometimes, you want to make sure that your query's cached data is up to date with your _server's_ data. Apollo Client supports two strategies for this: **polling** and **refetching**.

### Polling

Polling provides near-real-time synchronization with your server by executing your query periodically at a specified interval. To enable polling for a query, pass a `pollInterval` configuration option to the `useQuery` hook with an interval in milliseconds:

```jsx title="index.js" {4}
function DogPhoto({ breed }) {
  const { loading, error, data } = useQuery(GET_DOG_PHOTO, {
    variables: { breed },
    pollInterval: 500,
  });

  if (loading) return null;
  if (error) return `Error! ${error}`;

  return (
    <img src={data.dog.displayImage} style={{ height: 100, width: 100 }} />
  );
}
```

By setting `pollInterval` to 500, we fetch the current breed's image from the server every 0.5 seconds. Note that if you set `pollInterval` to `0`, the query does **not** poll.

> You can also start and stop polling dynamically with the [`startPolling` and `stopPolling` functions](#startpolling) that are returned by the `useQuery` hook. When using these functions, set the `pollInterval` configuration option as a parameter of the `startPolling` function.

### Refetching

Refetching enables you to refresh query results in response to a particular user
action, as opposed to using a fixed interval.

Let's add a button to our `DogPhoto` component that calls our query's
`refetch` function whenever it's clicked.

You can optionally provide a new `variables` object to the `refetch` function.
If you avoid passing a `variables` object and use only `refetch()`, the query
uses the same `variables` that it used in its previous execution.

```jsx {2,12} title="index.js"
function DogPhoto({ breed }) {
  const { loading, error, data, refetch } = useQuery(GET_DOG_PHOTO, {
    variables: { breed },
  });

  if (loading) return null;
  if (error) return `Error! ${error}`;

  return (
    <div>
      <img src={data.dog.displayImage} style={{ height: 100, width: 100 }} />
      <button onClick={() => refetch()}>
        Refetch new breed!
      </button>
    </div>
  );
}
```

Click the button and notice that the UI updates with a new dog photo. Refetching is an excellent way to guarantee fresh data, but it introduces some complexity with loading state. In the next section, we'll cover strategies for handling complex loading and error state.

#### Providing new variables to `refetch`

You call `refetch` with a new set of variables like so:

```jsx
<button
  onClick={() =>
    refetch({
      breed: 'dalmatian', // Always refetches a dalmatian instead of original breed
    })
  }
>
  Refetch!
</button>
```

If you provide new values for _some_ of your original query's variables but not _all_ of them, `refetch` uses each omitted variable's original value.

## Inspecting loading states

We've already seen that the `useQuery` hook exposes our query's current loading state. This is helpful when a query first loads, but what happens to our loading state when we're refetching or polling?

Let's return to our refetching example from the previous section. If you click the refetch button, you'll see that the component doesn't re-render until the new data arrives. What if we want to indicate to the user that we're refetching the photo?

The `useQuery` hook's result object provides fine-grained information about the status of the query via the `networkStatus` property. To take advantage
of this information, we set the `notifyOnNetworkStatusChange` option to `true` so our [query component](../api/react/components/ "Components - Client (React) - Apollo GraphQL Docs") re-renders while a refetch is in flight:

```jsx title="index.js" {4,8,12}
import { NetworkStatus } from '@apollo/client';

function DogPhoto({ breed }) {
  const { loading, error, data, refetch, networkStatus } = useQuery(
    GET_DOG_PHOTO,
    {
      variables: { breed },
      notifyOnNetworkStatusChange: true,
    }
  );

  if (networkStatus === NetworkStatus.refetch) return 'Refetching!';
  if (loading) return null;
  if (error) return `Error! ${error}`;

  return (
    <div>
      <img src={data.dog.displayImage} style={{ height: 100, width: 100 }} />
      <button onClick={() => refetch()}>
        Refetch!
      </button>
    </div>
  );
}
```

Enabling this option also ensures that the value of `loading` updates accordingly, even if you don't want to use the more fine-grained information provided by the `networkStatus` property.

The `networkStatus` property is a `NetworkStatus` enum that represents different loading states. Refetch is represented by `NetworkStatus.refetch`, and there are also values for polling and pagination. For a full list of all the possible loading states, check out the [source](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-client/blob/main/src/core/networkStatus.ts).

> To view a complete version of the app we just built, check out the CodeSandbox [here](https://codesandbox.io/s/queries-example-app-final-nrlnl).

## Inspecting error states

You can customize your query error handling by providing the `errorPolicy`
configuration option to the `useQuery` hook. The default value is `none`, which tells Apollo Client to treat all GraphQL errors as runtime errors. In this case, Apollo Client discards any query response data returned by the server and sets the `error` property in the `useQuery` result object.

If you set `errorPolicy` to `all`, `useQuery` does _not_ discard query response data, allowing you to render partial results.

For more information, see [Handling operation errors](./error-handling/).

## Manual execution with `useLazyQuery`

When React renders a component that calls `useQuery`, Apollo Client _automatically_ executes the corresponding query. But what if you want to execute a query in response to a different event, such as a user clicking a button?

The `useLazyQuery` hook is perfect for executing queries in response to events besides component rendering. Unlike with `useQuery`, when you call `useLazyQuery`, it does _not_ immediately execute its associated query. Instead, it returns a **query function** in its result tuple that you call whenever you're ready to execute the query.

Here's an example:

```jsx {2,5,13} title="index.js"
import React from 'react';
import { useLazyQuery } from '@apollo/client';

function DelayedQuery() {
  const [getDog, { loading, error, data }] = useLazyQuery(GET_DOG_PHOTO);

  if (loading) return <p>Loading ...</p>;
  if (error) return `Error! ${error}`;

  return (
    <div>
      {data?.dog && <img src={data.dog.displayImage} />}
      <button onClick={() => getDog({ variables: { breed: 'bulldog' } })}>
        Click me!
      </button>
    </div>
  );
}
```

The first item in `useLazyQuery`'s return tuple is the query function, and the second item is the same result object returned by `useQuery`.

As shown above, you can pass options to the query function just like you pass them to `useLazyQuery` itself. If you pass a particular option to _both_, the value you pass to the query function takes precedence. This is a handy way to pass _default_ options to `useLazyQuery` and then customize those options in the query function.

<Note>

Variables are merged by taking the `variables` passed as options to the hook and merging them with the `variables` passed to the query function. If you do not pass `variables` to the query function, only the `variables` passed to the hook are used in the query execution.

</Note>

For a full list of supported options, see the [API reference](../api/react/hooks/#uselazyquery).

## Setting a fetch policy

By default, the `useQuery` hook checks the Apollo Client cache to see if all the data you requested is already available locally. If all data _is_ available locally, `useQuery` returns that data and _doesn't_ query your GraphQL server. This `cache-first` policy is Apollo Client's default **fetch policy**.

You can specify a different fetch policy for a given query. To do so, include the `fetchPolicy` option in your call to `useQuery`:

```js {2}
const { loading, error, data } = useQuery(GET_DOGS, {
  fetchPolicy: 'network-only', // Doesn't check cache before making a network request
});
```
<MinVersion version="3.1">

### `nextFetchPolicy`

</MinVersion>

You can _also_ specify a query's `nextFetchPolicy`. If you do, `fetchPolicy` is used for the query's _first_ execution, and `nextFetchPolicy` is used to determine how the query responds to future cache updates:

```js {3}
const { loading, error, data } = useQuery(GET_DOGS, {
  fetchPolicy: 'network-only', // Used for first execution
  nextFetchPolicy: 'cache-first', // Used for subsequent executions
});
```

For example, this is helpful if you want a query to always make an initial network request, but you're comfortable reading from the cache after that.

#### `nextFetchPolicy` functions

If you want to apply a single `nextFetchPolicy` by default, because you find yourself manually providing `nextFetchPolicy` for most of your queries, you can configure `defaultOptions.watchQuery.nextFetchPolicy` when creating your `ApolloClient` instance:

```js
new ApolloClient({
  link,
  client,
  defaultOptions: {
    watchQuery: {
      nextFetchPolicy: 'cache-only',
    },
  },
});
```

This configuration applies to all `client.watchQuery` calls and `useQuery` calls that do not otherwise configure `nextFetchPolicy`.

If you want more control over how `nextFetchPolicy` behaves, you can provide a function instead of a `WatchQueryFetchPolicy` string:

```js
new ApolloClient({
  link,
  client,
  defaultOptions: {
    watchQuery: {
      nextFetchPolicy(currentFetchPolicy) {
        if (
          currentFetchPolicy === 'network-only' ||
          currentFetchPolicy === 'cache-and-network'
        ) {
          // Demote the network policies (except "no-cache") to "cache-first"
          // after the first request.
          return 'cache-first';
        }
        // Leave all other fetch policies unchanged.
        return currentFetchPolicy;
      },
    },
  },
});
```

This `nextFetchPolicy` function will be called after each request, and uses the `currentFetchPolicy` parameter to decide how to modify the fetch policy.

In addition to being called after each request, your `nextFetchPolicy` function will also be called when variables change, which by default resets the `fetchPolicy` to its initial value, which is often important to trigger a fresh network request for queries that started out with `cache-and-network` or `network-only` fetch policies.

To intercept and handle the `variables-changed` case yourself, you can use the `NextFetchPolicyContext` object passed as the second argument to your `nextFetchPolicy` function:

```js
new ApolloClient({
  link,
  client,
  defaultOptions: {
    watchQuery: {
      nextFetchPolicy(
        currentFetchPolicy,
        {
          // Either "after-fetch" or "variables-changed", indicating why the
          // nextFetchPolicy function was invoked.
          reason,
          // The rest of the options (currentFetchPolicy === options.fetchPolicy).
          options,
          // The original value of options.fetchPolicy, before nextFetchPolicy was
          // applied for the first time.
          initialFetchPolicy,
          // The ObservableQuery associated with this client.watchQuery call.
          observable,
        }
      ) {
        // When variables change, the default behavior is to reset
        // options.fetchPolicy to context.initialFetchPolicy. If you omit this logic,
        // your nextFetchPolicy function can override this default behavior to
        // prevent options.fetchPolicy from changing in this case.
        if (reason === 'variables-changed') {
          return initialFetchPolicy;
        }

        if (
          currentFetchPolicy === 'network-only' ||
          currentFetchPolicy === 'cache-and-network'
        ) {
          // Demote the network policies (except "no-cache") to "cache-first"
          // after the first request.
          return 'cache-first';
        }

        // Leave all other fetch policies unchanged.
        return currentFetchPolicy;
      },
    },
  },
});
```

In order to debug these `nextFetchPolicy` transitions, it can be useful to add `console.log` or `debugger` statements to the function body, to see when and why the function is called.

      <th>Name</th>
      <th>Description</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
<tr>
<td>

###### `cache-first`

</td>
<td>

Apollo Client first executes the query against the cache. If _all_ requested data is present in the cache, that data is returned. Otherwise, Apollo Client executes the query against your GraphQL server and returns that data after caching it.

Prioritizes minimizing the number of network requests sent by your application.

This is the default fetch policy.

</td>

###### `cache-only`

</td>
<td>

Apollo Client executes the query _only_ against the cache. It never queries your server in this case.

A `cache-only` query throws an error if the cache does not contain data for all requested fields.

</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>

###### `cache-and-network`

</td>
<td>

Apollo Client executes the full query against both the cache _and_ your GraphQL server. The query automatically updates if the result of the server-side query modifies cached fields.

Provides a fast response while also helping to keep cached data consistent with server data.

</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>

###### `network-only`

</td>
<td>

Apollo Client executes the full query against your GraphQL server, _without_ first checking the cache. The query's result _is_ stored in the cache.

Prioritizes consistency with server data, but can't provide a near-instantaneous response when cached data is available.

</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>

###### `no-cache`

</td>
<td>

Similar to `network-only`, except the query's result _is not_ stored in the cache.

</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>

###### `standby`

</td>
<td>

Uses the same logic as `cache-first`, except this query does _not_ automatically update when underlying field values change. You can still _manually_ update this query with `refetch` and `updateQueries`.

## `useQuery` API

Supported options and result fields for the `useQuery` hook are listed below.

Most calls to `useQuery` can omit the majority of these options, but it's useful to know they exist. To learn about the `useQuery` hook API in more detail with usage examples, see the [API reference](../api/react/hooks/#usequery).

### Options

The `useQuery` hook accepts the following options:

<PropertySignatureTable canonicalReference="@apollo/client!QueryHookOptions:interface" idPrefix="queryhookoptions-interface" />

### Result

After being called, the `useQuery` hook returns a result object with the following properties. This object contains your query result, plus some helpful functions for refetching, dynamic polling, and pagination.

<PropertySignatureTable canonicalReference="@apollo/client!QueryResult:interface" idPrefix="queryresult-interface" />

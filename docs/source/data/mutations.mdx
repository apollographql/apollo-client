Now that we've [learned how to query data](queries/) from our backend with Apollo Client, the natural next step is to learn how to _modify_ back-end data with **mutations**.

This article demonstrates how to send updates to your GraphQL server with the `useMutation` hook. You'll also learn how to update the Apollo Client cache after executing a mutation, and how to track loading and error states.

> To follow along with the examples below, open up our [starter project](https://codesandbox.io/s/mutations-example-app-start-gm7i5) and [sample GraphQL server](https://codesandbox.io/s/mutations-example-app-server-sxewr) on CodeSandbox. You can view the completed version of the app [here](https://codesandbox.io/s/mutations-example-app-final-tjoje).

## Prerequisites

This article assumes you're familiar with building basic GraphQL mutations. If you need a refresher, we recommend that you
[read this guide](http://graphql.org/learn/queries/#mutations).

This article also assumes that you've already set up Apollo Client and have wrapped your React app in an `ApolloProvider` component. For help with those steps, [get started](../get-started/).

## Executing a mutation

The `useMutation` [React hook](https://react.dev/reference/react) is the primary API for executing mutations in an Apollo application.

To execute a mutation, you first call `useMutation` within a React component and pass it the mutation you want to execute, like so:

```jsx {13} title="my-component.jsx"
import { gql, useMutation } from '@apollo/client';

// Define mutation
const INCREMENT_COUNTER = gql`
  # Increments a back-end counter and gets its resulting value
  mutation IncrementCounter {
    currentValue
  }
`;

function MyComponent() {
  // Pass mutation to useMutation
  const [mutateFunction, { data, loading, error }] = useMutation(INCREMENT_COUNTER);
}
```

As shown above, you use the `gql` function to parse the mutation string into a GraphQL document that you then pass to `useMutation`.

When your component renders, `useMutation` returns a tuple that includes:

* A **mutate function** that you can call at any time to execute the mutation
    * Unlike `useQuery`, `useMutation` _doesn't_ execute its operation automatically on render. Instead, you call this mutate function.
* An object with fields that represent the current status of the mutation's execution (`data`, `loading`, etc.)
    * This object is similar to the object returned by the `useQuery` hook. For details, see [Result](#result).

### Example

Let's say we're creating a to-do list application and we want the user to be able to add items to their list. First, we'll create a corresponding GraphQL mutation named `ADD_TODO`. Remember to wrap GraphQL strings in the `gql` function to parse them into query documents:

```jsx title="add-todo.jsx"
import { gql, useMutation } from '@apollo/client';

const ADD_TODO = gql`
  mutation AddTodo($type: String!) {
    addTodo(type: $type) {
      id
      type
    }
  }
`;
```

Next, we'll create a component named `AddTodo` that represents the submission form for the to-do list. Inside it, we'll pass our
`ADD_TODO` mutation to the `useMutation` hook:

```jsx {3,13} title="add-todo.jsx"
function AddTodo() {
  let input;
  const [addTodo, { data, loading, error }] = useMutation(ADD_TODO);

  if (loading) return 'Submitting...';
  if (error) return `Submission error! ${error.message}`;

  return (
    <div>
      <form
        onSubmit={e => {
          e.preventDefault();
          addTodo({ variables: { type: input.value } });
          input.value = '';
        }}
      >
        <input
          ref={node => {
            input = node;
          }}
        />
        <button type="submit">Add Todo</button>
      </form>
    </div>
  );
}
```

In this example, our form's `onSubmit` handler calls the **mutate function** (named `addTodo`) that's returned by the `useMutation` hook. This tells Apollo Client to execute the mutation by sending it to our GraphQL server.

> Note that this behavior differs from [`useQuery`](./queries/), which executes its operation as soon as its component renders. This is because mutations are more commonly executed in response to a user action (such as submitting a form in this case).

### Providing options

The `useMutation` hook accepts an `options` object as its second parameter. Here's an example that provides some default values for GraphQL `variables`:

```js
const [addTodo, { data, loading, error }] = useMutation(ADD_TODO, {
  variables: {
    type: "placeholder",
    someOtherVariable: 1234,
  },
});
```

> All supported options are listed in [Options](#options).

You can _also_ provide options directly to your mutate function, as demonstrated in this snippet from [the example above](#example):

```js
addTodo({
  variables: {
    type: input.value,
  },
});
```

Here, we use the `variables` option to provide the values of any GraphQL variables that our mutation requires (specifically, the `type` of the created to-do item).

#### Option precedence

If you provide the same option to both `useMutation` _and_ your mutate function, the mutate function's value takes precedence. In the specific case of the `variables` option, the two objects are merged _shallowly_, which means any variables provided only to `useMutation` are preserved in the resulting object. This helps you set default values for variables.

In [the example snippets above](#providing-options), `input.value` would override `"placeholder"` as the value of the `type` variable. The value of `someOtherVariable` (`1234`) would be preserved.

### Tracking mutation status

In addition to a mutate function, the `useMutation` hook returns an object that represents the current state of the mutation's execution. The fields of this object (listed in [Result](#result)) include booleans that indicate whether the mutate function has been `called` yet, and whether the mutation's result is currently `loading`.

[The example above](#example) destructures the `loading` and `error` fields from this object to render the `AddTodo` component differently depending on the mutation's current status:

```jsx
if (loading) return 'Submitting...';
if (error) return `Submission error! ${error.message}`;
```

> The `useMutation` hook also supports `onCompleted` and `onError` options if you prefer to use callbacks. [See the API reference.](../api/react/hooks/#options-2)

### Resetting mutation status

The mutation result object returned by `useMutation` includes a [`reset` function](#mutationresult-interface-reset):

```js
const [login, { data, loading, error, reset }] = useMutation(LOGIN_MUTATION);
```

Call `reset` to reset the mutation's result to its initial state (i.e., _before_ the mutate function was called). You can use this to enable users to dismiss mutation result data or errors in the UI.

> Calling `reset` does _not_ remove any cached data returned by the mutation's execution. It only affects the state associated with the `useMutation` hook, causing the corresponding component to rerender.

```js {2,15}
function LoginPage () {
  const [login, { error, reset }] = useMutation(LOGIN_MUTATION);

  return (
    <>
      <form>
        <input class="login"/>
        <input class="password"/>
        <button onclick={login}>Login</button>
      </form>
      {
        error &&
        <LoginFailedMessageWindow
          message={error.message}
          onDismiss={() => reset()}
        />
      }
    </>
  );
}
```

## Updating local data

When you execute a mutation, you modify back-end data. Usually, you then want to update your _locally cached_ data to reflect the back-end modification. For example, if you execute a mutation to add an item to your to-do list, you also want that item to appear in your cached copy of the list.

### Supported methods

The most straightforward way to update your local data is to [refetch any queries](#refetching-queries) that might be affected by the mutation. However, this method requires additional network requests.

If your mutation returns all of the objects and fields that it modified, you can [update your cache directly](#updating-the-cache-directly) _without_ making any followup network requests. However, this method increases in complexity as your mutations become more complex.

If you're just getting started with Apollo Client, we recommend refetching queries to update your cached data. After you get that working, you can improve your app's responsiveness by updating the cache directly.

## Refetching queries

If you know that your app usually needs to refetch certain queries after a particular mutation, you can include a `refetchQueries` array in that mutation's options:

```js {3-6}
// Refetches two queries after mutation completes
const [addTodo, { data, loading, error }] = useMutation(ADD_TODO, {
  refetchQueries: [
    GET_POST, // DocumentNode object parsed with gql
    'GetComments' // Query name
  ],
});
```

> You can only refetch _active_ queries. Active queries are those used by components on the current page. If the data you want to update is not fetched by a component on the current page, it's best to [update your cache directly](#updating-the-cache-directly).

Each element in the `refetchQueries` array is one of the following:

* A `DocumentNode` object parsed with the `gql` function
* The name of a query you've previously executed, as a string (e.g., `GetComments`)
  * To refer to queries by name, make sure each of your app's queries have a _unique_ name.

Each included query is executed with its most recently provided set of variables.

You can provide the `refetchQueries` option either to `useMutation` or to the mutate function. For details, see [Option precedence](#option-precedence).

Note that in an app with tens or hundreds of different queries, it can be challenging to determine exactly which queries to refetch after a particular mutation.

## Updating the cache directly

### Include modified objects in mutation responses

In most cases, a mutation response should include any object(s) the mutation modified. This enables Apollo Client to normalize those objects and cache them according to their `__typename` and `id` fields ([by default](../caching/cache-configuration/#customizing-cache-ids)).

[In the example above](#example), our `ADD_TODO` mutation might return a `Todo` object with the following structure:

```json
{
  "__typename": "Todo",
  "id": "5",
  "type": "groceries"
}
```

> Apollo Client automatically adds the `__typename` field to every object in your queries and mutations by default.

Upon receiving this response object, Apollo Client caches it with key `Todo:5`. If a cached object _already_ exists with this key, Apollo Client overwrites any existing fields that are also included in the mutation response (other existing fields are preserved).

Returning modified objects like this is a helpful first step to keeping your cache in sync with your backend. However, it isn't always sufficient. For example, a newly cached object isn't automatically added to any _list fields_ that should now include that object. To accomplish this, you can define an [`update` function](#the-update-function).

### The `update` function

When a [mutation's response](#include-modified-objects-in-mutation-responses) is insufficient to update _all_ modified fields in your cache (such as certain list fields), you can define an `update` function to apply manual changes to your cached data after a mutation.

You provide an `update` function to `useMutation`, like so:

```jsx {12-29}
const GET_TODOS = gql`
  query GetTodos {
    todos {
      id
    }
  }
`;

function AddTodo() {
  let input;
  const [addTodo] = useMutation(ADD_TODO, {
    update(cache, { data: { addTodo } }) {
      cache.modify({
        fields: {
          todos(existingTodos = []) {
            const newTodoRef = cache.writeFragment({
              data: addTodo,
              fragment: gql`
                fragment NewTodo on Todo {
                  id
                  type
                }
              `
            });
            return [...existingTodos, newTodoRef];
          }
        }
      });
    }
  });

  return (
    <div>
      <form
        onSubmit={e => {
          e.preventDefault();
          addTodo({ variables: { type: input.value } });
          input.value = "";
        }}
      >
        <input
          ref={node => {
            input = node;
          }}
        />
        <button type="submit">Add Todo</button>
      </form>
    </div>
  );
}
```

As shown, the `update` function is passed a `cache` object that represents the Apollo Client cache. This object provides access to cache API methods like `readQuery`/`writeQuery`, `readFragment`/`writeFragment`, `modify`, and `evict`. These methods enable you to execute GraphQL operations on the cache as though you're interacting with a GraphQL server.

> Learn more about supported cache functions in [Interacting with cached data](../caching/cache-interaction/).

The `update` function is _also_ passed an object with a `data` property that contains the result of the mutation. You can use this value to update the cache with `cache.writeQuery`, `cache.writeFragment`, or `cache.modify`.

> If your mutation specifies an [optimistic response](../performance/optimistic-ui/), your `update` function is called **twice**: once with the optimistic result, and again with the actual result of the mutation when it returns.

When the `ADD_TODO` mutation executes in the above example, the newly added and returned `addTodo` object is automatically saved into the cache _before_ the `update` function runs. However, the cached list of `ROOT_QUERY.todos` (which is watched by the `GET_TODOS` query) is _not_ automatically updated. This means that the `GET_TODOS` query isn't notified of the new `Todo` object, which in turn means that the query doesn't update to show the new item.

To address this, we use `cache.modify` to surgically insert or delete items from the cache, by running "modifier" functions. In the example above, we know the results of the `GET_TODOS` query are stored in the `ROOT_QUERY.todos` array in the cache, so we use a `todos` modifier function to update the cached array to include a reference to the newly added `Todo`. With the help of `cache.writeFragment`, we get an internal reference to the added `Todo`, then append that reference to the `ROOT_QUERY.todos` array.

Any changes you make to cached data inside of an `update` function are automatically broadcast to queries that are listening for changes to that data. Consequently, your application's UI will update to reflect these updated cached values.

### Refetching after `update`

An `update` function attempts to replicate a mutation's back-end modifications in your client's local cache. These cache modifications are broadcast to all affected active queries, which updates your UI automatically. If the `update` function does this correctly, your users see the latest data immediately, without needing to await another network round trip.

However, an `update` function might get this replication _wrong_ by setting a cached value incorrectly. You can "double check" your `update` function's modifications by refetching affected active queries. To do so, you first provide an `onQueryUpdated` callback function to your mutate function:

```js {6-11}
addTodo({
  variables: { type: input.value },
  update(cache, result) {
    // Update the cache as an approximation of server-side mutation effects
  },
  onQueryUpdated(observableQuery) {
    // Define any custom logic for determining whether to refetch
    if (shouldRefetchQuery(observableQuery)) {
      return observableQuery.refetch();
    }
  },
})
```

After your `update` function completes, Apollo Client calls `onQueryUpdated` _once for each active query with cached fields that were updated_. Within `onQueryUpdated`, you can use any custom logic to determine whether you want to refetch the associated query.

To refetch a query from `onQueryUpdated`, call `return observableQuery.refetch()`, as shown above. Otherwise, no return value is required. If a refetched query's response differs from your `update` function's modifications, your cache and UI are both automatically updated again. Otherwise, your users see no change.

Occasionally, it might be difficult to make your `update` function update all relevant queries. Not every mutation returns enough information for the `update` function to do its job effectively. To make absolutely sure a certain query is included, you can combine `onQueryUpdated` with `refetchQueries: [...]`:

```js
addTodo({
  variables: { type: input.value },
  update(cache, result) {
    // Update the cache as an approximation of server-side mutation effects.
  },
  // Force ReallyImportantQuery to be passed to onQueryUpdated.
  refetchQueries: ["ReallyImportantQuery"],
  onQueryUpdated(observableQuery) {
    // If ReallyImportantQuery is active, it will be passed to onQueryUpdated.
    // If no query with that name is active, a warning will be logged.
  },
})
```

If `ReallyImportantQuery` was already going to be passed to `onQueryUpdated` thanks to your `update` function, then it will only be passed once. Using `refetchQueries: ["ReallyImportantQuery"]` just guarantees the query will be included.

If you find you've included more queries than you expected, you can skip or ignore a query by returning `false` from `onQueryUpdated`, after examining the `ObservableQuery` to determine that it doesn't need refetching. Returning a `Promise` from `onQueryUpdated` causes the final `Promise<FetchResult<TData>>` for the mutation to await any promises returned from `onQueryUpdated`, eliminating the need for the legacy `awaitRefetchQueries: true` option.

To use the `onQueryUpdated` API without performing a mutation, try the [`client.refetchQueries`](./refetching/#clientrefetchqueries) method. In the standalone `client.refetchQueries` API, the `refetchQueries: [...]` mutation option is called `include: [...]`, and the `update` function is called `updateCache` for clarity. Otherwise, the same internal system powers both `client.refetchQueries` and refetching queries after a mutation.

## `useMutation` API

Supported options and result fields for the `useMutation` hook are listed below.

Most calls to `useMutation` can omit the majority of these options, but it's
useful to know they exist. To learn about the `useMutation` hook API in more
detail with usage examples, see the [API reference](../api/react/hooks/).

### Options

The `useMutation` hook accepts the following options:

<PropertySignatureTable canonicalReference="@apollo/client!MutationHookOptions:interface" idPrefix="mutationhookoptions-interface" />

### Result

The `useMutation` result is a tuple with a mutate function in the first position and an object representing the mutation result in the second position.

You call the mutate function to trigger the mutation from your UI.

<PropertySignatureTable canonicalReference="@apollo/client!MutationResult:interface" idPrefix="mutationresult-interface" />

## Next steps

The `useQuery` and `useMutation` hooks together represent Apollo Client's core
API for performing GraphQL operations. Now that you're familiar with both,
you can begin to take advantage of Apollo Client's full feature set, including:

- [Optimistic UI](../performance/optimistic-ui/): Learn how to improve perceived performance by returning an optimistic response before your mutation result comes back from the server.
- [Local state](../local-state/local-state-management/): Use Apollo Client to manage the entirety of your application's local state by executing client-side mutations.
- [Caching in Apollo](../caching/cache-configuration/): Dive deep into the Apollo Client cache and how it's normalized. Understanding the cache is helpful when writing `update` functions for your mutations!

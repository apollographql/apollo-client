# üîÆ Apollo Client Ecosystem Roadmap

**Last updated: 2025-10-01**

For up to date release notes, refer to the project's [Changelog](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-client/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md).

> **Please note:** This is an approximation of **larger effort** work planned for the next 6 - 12 months. It does not cover all new functionality that will be added, and nothing here is set in stone. Also note that each of these releases, and several patch releases in-between, will include bug fixes (based on issue triaging) and community submitted PRs.

## ‚úã Community feedback & prioritization

- Please report feature requests or bugs as a new [issue](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-client/issues/new/choose).
- If you already see an issue that interests you please add a üëç or a comment so we can measure community interest.

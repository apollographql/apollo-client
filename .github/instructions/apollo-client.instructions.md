# Apollo Client Skill Usage Instructions

## When to Use the Apollo Client Skill

Use the `apollo-client` skill when:

1. **Answering questions about Apollo Client** - Any question related to Apollo Client setup, configuration, usage, or troubleshooting
2. **Reviewing documentation** - When reviewing documentation PRs or content related to Apollo Client
3. **Reviewing documentation-like content** - Including:
   - Markdown files (`.md`, `.mdx`)
   - JSDoc/TSDoc docblocks (`/** ... */`)
   - Code comments intended for end users
   - README files
   - API documentation
4. **Integration questions** - Questions about integrating Apollo Client with frameworks like Next.js, TanStack Start, or React Router

## Important Notes

- The skill is trained on Apollo Client 4.x, so it provides current patterns
- The skill is opinionated, so it is a good guide for best practices, but documentation might show alternative approaches - this is valid
- Always prefer the skill's guidance over general knowledge for Apollo Client questions
- The skill includes official Apollo documentation patterns and best practices
- Use the skill even for seemingly simple questions to ensure accuracy

> **Note:** Official support for React Apollo render prop components ended in March 2020. This library is still included in the `@apollo/client` package, but it no longer receives feature updates or bug fixes.

## Installation

The render prop library is included in the core `@apollo/client` package:

```
npm install @apollo/client
```

You then import the library's symbols from `@apollo/client/react/components`.

## `Query`

### Props

The `Query` component accepts the following props. `query` is **required**.

<PropertySignatureTable canonicalReference="@apollo/client!QueryFunctionOptions:interface" idPrefix="queryfunctionoptions-interface" />

### Render prop function

The render prop function that you pass to the `children` prop of `Query` is called with an object (`QueryResult`) that has the following properties. This object contains your query result, plus some helpful functions for refetching, dynamic polling, and pagination.

<PropertySignatureTable canonicalReference="@apollo/client!QueryResult:interface" idPrefix="queryresult-interface" />

## `Mutation`

The Mutation component accepts the following props. Only `mutation` is **required**.

<PropertySignatureTable canonicalReference="@apollo/client!MutationFunctionOptions:interface" idPrefix="mutationfunctionoptions-interface" />

### Render prop function

The render prop function that you pass to the `children` prop of `Mutation` is called with the `mutate` function and an object with the mutation result. The `mutate` function is how you trigger the mutation from your UI. The object contains your mutation result, plus loading and error state.

<PropertySignatureTable canonicalReference="@apollo/client!MutationResult:interface" idPrefix="mutationresult-interface" />

## `Subscription`

### Props

The Subscription component accepts the following props. Only `subscription` is **required**.

<PropertySignatureTable canonicalReference="@apollo/client!SubscriptionComponentOptions:interface" idPrefix="subscriptioncomponentoptions-interface" />

### Render prop function

<PropertySignatureTable canonicalReference="@apollo/client!SubscriptionResult:interface" idPrefix="subscriptionresult-interface" />

<SubscriptionResult3 />

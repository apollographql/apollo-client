title: Configuring the Apollo Client cache
---

This article describes cache setup and configuration. To learn how to interact with cached data, see [Reading and writing data to the cache](./cache-interaction).

## Initialization

Create an `InMemoryCache` object and provide it to the `ApolloClient` constructor, like so:

```ts
import { InMemoryCache, ApolloClient } from '@apollo/client';

const client = new ApolloClient({
  // ...other arguments...
  cache: new InMemoryCache(options)
});
```

The `InMemoryCache` constructor accepts a variety of [configuration options](#configuration-options).

## Configuration options

You can configure the cache's behavior to better suit your application. For example, you can:

* Customize the format of a particular type's [cache ID](#customizing-cache-ids)
* Customize the storage and retrieval of [individual fields](./cache-field-behavior/)
* Define polymorphic type relationships for [fragment matching](#possibletypes)
* Define patterns for [pagination](../pagination/overview/)
* Manage client-side [local state](../local-state/local-state-management/)

To customize cache behavior, you provide a configuration object to the `InMemoryCache` constructor. This object supports the following fields:

<table class="field-table api-ref">
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Name /<br/>Type</th>
      <th>Description</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>

<tbody>
<tr>
<td>

###### `addTypename`

`Boolean`

</td>
<td>

If `true`, the cache automatically requests the `__typename` field for every object in your outgoing operations, which means you can omit `__typename` from your operation definitions.

By default, the cache uses the `__typename` field as part of the cache ID for every cached object, so it's helpful to guarantee that the field is always fetched.

The default value is `true`.

</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>

###### `resultCaching`

`Boolean`

</td>
<td>

If `true`, the cache returns an identical (`===`) response object for every execution of the same query, as long as the underlying data remains unchanged. This helps you detect changes to a query's result.

The default value is `true`.

</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>

###### `possibleTypes`

`Object`

</td>
<td>

Include this object to define polymorphic relationships between your schema's types. Doing so enables you to look up cached data by interface or by union.

Each key in the object is the `__typename` of an interface or union, and the corresponding value is an array of the `__typename`s of the types that belong to that union or implement that interface.

For an example, see [Defining `possibleTypes` manually](../data/fragments/#defining-possibletypes-manually).

</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>

###### `typePolicies`

`Object`

</td>
<td>

Include this object to customize the cache's behavior on a type-by-type basis.

Each key in the object is the `__typename` of a type to customize, and the corresponding value is a [`TypePolicy` object](#typepolicy-fields).

</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>

###### `dataIdFromObject`

`Function`

</td>
<td>

A function that takes a response object and returns a unique identifier to be used when normalizing the data in the store.

For details, see [Customizing identifier generation globally](#customizing-identifier-generation-globally).

</td>
</tr>

## Customizing cache IDs

You can customize how the `InMemoryCache` generates cache IDs for individual types in your schema ([see the default behavior](./overview/#2-generate-cache-ids)). This is helpful especially if a type uses a field (or fields!) _besides_ `id` or `_id` as its unique identifier.

To accomplish this, you define a `TypePolicy` for each type you want to customize. You specify all of your cache's `typePolicies` in [the `options` object you provide to the `InMemoryCache` constructor](#configuration-options).

Include a `keyFields` field in relevant `TypePolicy` objects, like so:

```ts
const cache = new InMemoryCache({
  typePolicies: {
    Product: {
      // In an inventory management system, products might be identified
      // by their UPC.
      keyFields: ["upc"],
    },
    Person: {
      // In a user account system, the combination of a person's name AND email
      // address might uniquely identify them.
      keyFields: ["name", "email"],
    },
    Book: {
      // If one of the keyFields is an object with fields of its own, you can
      // include those nested keyFields by using a nested array of strings:
      keyFields: ["title", "author", ["name"]],
    },
    AllProducts: {
      // Singleton types that have no identifying field can use an empty
      // array for their keyFields.
      keyFields: [],
    },
  },
});
```

This example shows a variety of `typePolicies` with different `keyFields`:

* The `Product` type uses its `upc` field as its identifying field.
* The `Person` type uses the combination of both its `name` _and_ `email` fields.
* The `Book` type includes a _subfield_ as part of its cache ID.
    * The `["name"]` item indicates that the `name` field of the _previous_ field in the array (`author`) is part of the cache ID. The `Book`'s `author` field must be an object that includes a `name` field for this to be valid.
    * A valid cache ID for the `Book` type has the following structure:
        ```
        Book:{"title":"Fahrenheit 451","author":{"name":"Ray Bradbury"}}
        ```
* The `AllProducts` type illustrates a special strategy for a **singleton** type. If the cache will only ever contain one `AllProducts` object and that object has _no_ identifying fields, you can provide an empty array for its `keyFields`.

If an object has multiple `keyFields`, the cache ID always lists those fields in the same order to ensure uniqueness.

Note that these `keyFields` strings always refer to the canonical field names defined in the schema. This means that ID computation is _not_ sensitive to [field aliases](/resources/graphql-glossary/#alias).

### Calculating an object's cache ID

If you define a custom cache ID that uses multiple fields, it can be challenging to calculate and provide that ID to methods that require it (such as `cache.readFragment`).

To help with this, you can use the `cache.identify` method to calculate the cache ID for any normalized object you fetch from your cache. See [Obtaining an object's custom ID](./cache-interaction/#obtaining-an-objects-cache-id).

### Customizing identifier generation globally

If you need to define a single fallback `keyFields` function that isn't specific to any particular `__typename`, you can use the `dataIdFromObject` function that was introduced in Apollo Client 2.x:

```ts
import { defaultDataIdFromObject } from '@apollo/client';

const cache = new InMemoryCache({
  dataIdFromObject(responseObject) {
    switch (responseObject.__typename) {
      case 'Product': return `Product:${responseObject.upc}`;
      case 'Person': return `Person:${responseObject.name}:${responseObject.email}`;
      default: return defaultDataIdFromObject(responseObject);
    }
  }
});
```

> The `dataIdFromObject` API is included in Apollo Client 3 to ease the transition from Apollo Client 2.x.

Notice that the above function still uses different logic to generate keys based on an object's `__typename`. In a case like this, you should almost always define `keyFields` arrays for the `Product` and `Person` types via `typePolicies`.

This code also has the following drawbacks:

* It's sensitive to aliasing mistakes.
* It does nothing to protect against undefined object properties.
* Accidentally using different key fields at different times can cause inconsistencies in the cache.

### Disabling normalization

You can instruct the `InMemoryCache` _not_ to normalize objects of a particular type. This can be useful for metrics and other transient data that's identified by a timestamp and never receives updates.

To disable normalization for a type, define a `TypePolicy` for the type (as shown in [Customizing cache IDs](#customizing-cache-ids)) and set the policy's `keyFields` field to `false`.

Objects that are not normalized are instead embedded within their _parent_ object in the cache. You can't access these objects directly, but you can access them via their parent.

## `TypePolicy` fields

To customize how the cache interacts with specific types in your schema, you can pass the `InMemoryCache` constructor an object that maps `__typename` strings to `TypePolicy` objects.

A `TypePolicy` object can include the following fields:

```ts
type TypePolicy = {
  // Allows defining the primary key fields for this type, either using an
  // array of field names, a function that returns an arbitrary string, or
  // false to disable normalization for objects of this type.
  keyFields?: KeySpecifier | KeyFieldsFunction | false;

  // If your schema uses a custom __typename for any of the root Query,
  // Mutation, and/or Subscription types (rare), set the corresponding
  // field below to true to indicate that this type serves as that type.
  queryType?: true,
  mutationType?: true,
  subscriptionType?: true,

  fields?: {
    [fieldName: string]:
      | FieldPolicy<StoreValue>
      | FieldReadFunction<StoreValue>;
  }
};

// Recursive type aliases are coming in TypeScript 3.7, so this isn't the
// actual type we use, but it's what it should be:
type KeySpecifier = (string | KeySpecifier)[];

type KeyFieldsFunction = (
  object: Readonly<StoreObject>,
  context: {
    typename: string;
    selectionSet?: SelectionSetNode;
    fragmentMap?: FragmentMap;
  },
) => string | null | void;
```

### Overriding root operation types (uncommon)

In addition to `keyFields`, a `TypePolicy` can indicate that its type represents the root query, mutation, or subscription type by setting `queryType`, `mutationType`, or `subscriptionType` to `true`:

```ts
const cache = new InMemoryCache({
  typePolicies: {
    UnconventionalRootQuery: {
      // The RootQueryFragment can only match if the cache knows the __typename
      // of the root query object.
      queryType: true,
    },
  },
});

const result = cache.readQuery({
  query: gql`
    query MyQuery {
      ...RootQueryFragment
    }
    fragment RootQueryFragment on UnconventionalRootQuery {
      field1
      field2 {
        subfield
      }
    }
  `,
});

const equivalentResult = cache.readQuery({
  query: gql`
    query MyQuery {
      field1
      field2 {
        subfield
      }
    }
  `,
});
```

The cache usually obtains `__typename` information by adding the `__typename` field to every query selection set it sends to the server. It could technically use this same method for the outermost selection set of every operation, but the `__typename`s of the root query and mutation are almost always `"Query"` and `"Mutation"`, so the cache assumes those common defaults unless instructed otherwise in a `TypePolicy`.

For most objects in a graph, the `__typename` field is vital for proper identification and normalization. For the root query and mutation types, the `__typename` is not nearly as useful or important, because those types are singletons with only one instance per client.

### The `fields` property

The final property within `TypePolicy` is the `fields` property, which enables you to [customize the behavior of individual cached fields](./cache-field-behavior).

title: Field policies and reactive variables
description: Manage and respond to local state changes reactively
---

Field policies provide a way to manage data on its way into or out of the cache for specific fields in your GraphQL operations. They are explained in more detail in [Customizing the behavior of cached fields](../caching/cache-field-behavior/), but it's important to note that they can also be used help drive fields that don't actually exist in your cache. Field policies can be used to create virtual client side only fields that you can customize to perform any task, or return any data you would like, when called as part of your full GraphQL operation. They can be used to read and write from the cache or be combined with other state API's like Apollo Client reactive variables. Virtual fields are triggered anytime you call a GraphQL operation in Apollo Client, letting you blend fully custom local behavior with your remote queries, getting the results back in a combined response.

The following sections dive into more detail around reading and writing local state using field policies and the Apollo Client cache, but let's first look at another important local state API called reactive variables.

## Reactive variables

Reactive variables are simple functions that allow you to store local state in a well-known and private location, outside of the Apollo Client cache. Since reactive variable state isn't stored in the cache, reactive variables don't have to follow the data graph design requirements of the cache, which means they can be used to store anything you would like. They can then be passed around and consumed by your application, and updated at any point.

Reactive variables are created by calling the `InMemoryCache` class `makeVar` method, along with an optional initial value passed in as the first parameter.

```js
import { InMemoryCache } from '@apollo/client';

const cache = new InMemoryCache();

const cartItems = cache.makeVar([]);
```

Here we've created a new array for tracking products added to a shopping cart, by passing an empty array into `makeVar`.

To retrieve the current value of a reactive variable, just call the created reactive variable function.

```js
const cartItems = cache.makeVar([]);

// Output: []
console.log(cartItems());
```

To set a new value as the reactive variable state, pass the new value into the reactive variable function.

```js
const cartItems = cache.makeVar([]);

cartItems([100, 101, 102]);

// Output: [100, 101, 102]
console.log(cartItems());

cartItems([456]);

// Output: [456]
console.log(cartItems());
```

While reactive variables can be passed around your application and used as simple state containers, as their name implies they can also be used to trigger reactive changes in your application. Each time you call a reactive variable function with a new value, the new value is stored so it can be retrieved again in the future. At the same time the fact that a new value has been received is also broadcast to other parts of Apollo Client. Anything that has registered to receive updates when a reactive variable changes will get notified of the new data, and have a chance to act on it. We'll look at how this functionality can be combined with field policies to automatically re-run queries and dynamically update parts of your application, in [Using reactive variables to track `@client` state](#using-reactive-variables-to-track-client-state).

## Querying local state

Querying for local data is very similar to querying your GraphQL server. The only difference is that you add a `@client` directive on your local fields to indicate they should be resolved by an Apollo Client [field policy](../caching/cache-field-behavior/) or from the cache directly. Let's look at an example:

```jsx
import React from "react";
import { gql, useQuery } from "@apollo/client";

import Todo from "./Todo";

const GET_TODOS = gql`
  {
    todos @client {
      id
      completed
      text
    }
  }
`;

function TodoList() {
  const { data: { todos } } = useQuery(GET_TODOS);
  return (
    <ul>
      {todos.map(todo => <Todo key={todo.id} {...todo} />)}
    </ul>
  );
}
```

Here we create our GraphQL query and add an `@client` directive to `todos`. We then pass the query to the `useQuery` hook. The `@client` directive lets the `useQuery` component know that `todos` should be calculated by running a pre-defined field policy read function or pulled from the Apollo Client cache directly. The following sections help explain how both options work in more detail.

> ⚠️ Since the above query runs as soon as the component is mounted, what do we do if there are no todos in the cache or there aren't any field policies defined to help calculate `todos`? We need to write an initial state to the cache before the query is run to prevent it from erroring out. Refer to the [Initializing the cache](#initializing-the-cache) section below for more information.

> ⚠️ It's important to note that fields marked with the `@client` directive are never sent over a network to backend API's. Apollo Client strips `@client` fields before operations are sent through its internal Link chain.

### Initializing the cache

Often, you'll need to write an initial state to the cache so any components querying data before a mutation is triggered don't error out. To accomplish this, you can use `cache.writeQuery` to prep the cache with initial values.

```js
import { InMemoryCache } from '@apollo/client';

const cache = new InMemoryCache();

cache.writeQuery({
  query: gql`
    query {
      todos
      networkStatus {
        isConnected
      }
    }
  `,
  data: {
    todos: [],
    networkStatus: {
      __typename: 'NetworkStatus',
      isConnected: false,
    },
  },
});
```

Sometimes you may need to [reset the cache](../api/core/#ApolloClient.resetStore) in your application, when a user logs out for example. If you call `client.resetStore` anywhere in your application, you will likely want to initialize your cache again. You can do this using the `client.onResetStore` method to register a callback that will call `cache.writeQuery` again.

```js
import { ApolloClient, InMemoryCache } from '@apollo/client';

const cache = new InMemoryCache();
const client = new ApolloClient({ cache });

function writeInitialData() {
  cache.writeQuery({
    query: gql`
      query {
        todos
        networkStatus {
          isConnected
        }
      }
    `,
    data: {
      todos: [],
      networkStatus: {
        __typename: 'NetworkStatus',
        isConnected: false,
      },
    },
  });
}

writeInitialData();

client.onResetStore(writeInitialData);
```

### Local data query flow

When a query containing `@client` directives is executed, Apollo Client runs through a few sequential steps to try to find a result for the `@client` field. Let's use the following query to walk through the local data look up flow:

```js
const GET_LAUNCH_DETAILS = gql`
  query LaunchDetails($launchId: ID!) {
    launch(id: $launchId) {
      site
      seatsBooked
      hasAvailableSeats @client
      rocket {
        type
      }
    }
  }
`;
```

This query includes a mixture of both remote and local fields. `hasAvailableSeats` is the only field marked with an `@client` directive, so it's the field we'll focus on. When Apollo Client executes this query and tries to find a result for the `hasAvailableSeats` field, it runs through the following steps:

1. Has a [field policy read function](../caching/cache-field-behavior/#the-read-function) been defined for the `hasAvailableSeats` field? If yes, run and return the result from the read function. For example:

```js
const MAX_SEATS = 10;
const cache = new InMemoryCache({
  typePolicies: {
    Launch: {
      fields: {
        hasAvailableSeats(_, { readField }) {
          // Return true if the number of booked seats is less
          // than the seat maximum.
          return readField('seatsBooked') < MAX_SEATS;
        },
      },
    },
  },
});
```

2. If a matching read function can't be found, check the Apollo Client cache to see if a `hasAvailableSeats` value can be found in the cache. If so, return that value.

Let's look at both of these steps more closely.

- Retrieving `@client` data with the help of read functions (step 1 above) is explained in [Handling `@client` fields with field policies](#handling-client-fields-with-field-policies).
- Loading `@client` data from the cache (step 2 above) is explained in [Handling `@client` fields with the cache](#handling-client-fields-with-the-cache).

### Handling `@client` fields with field policies

Apollo Client [field policies](../caching/cache-field-behavior) can be used to locally compute GraphQL query fields that use a `@client` directive. This means that instead of sending your full GraphQL query to a remote GraphQL endpoint, which then runs resolver functions against your query to populate and return a result set, Apollo Client can run locally defined `read` functions to compute the value of `@client` fields. Let's look at an example:

```js
import { ApolloClient, InMemoryCache, gql } from '@apollo/client';

const cache = new InMemoryCache({
  typePolicies: {
    Launch: {
      fields: {
        isInCart: {
          read(_, { variables }) {
            return localStorage.getItem('CART').includes(
              variables.launchId
            );
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
});

const client = new ApolloClient({
  uri: 'http://localhost:4000/graphql',
  cache,
});

const GET_LAUNCH_DETAILS = gql`
  query LaunchDetails($launchId: ID!) {
    launch(id: $launchId) {
      isInCart @client
      site
      rocket {
        type
      }
    }
  }
`;

// ... run the query using client.query, a useQuery hook, etc.
```

Here when the `GET_LAUNCH_DETAILS` query is executed, Apollo Client looks for a field policy `read` function that is associated with the `isInCart` field. It finds one as we've defined a `read` function for the `isInCart` field in the `InMemoryCache` constructor. This `read` function is run, then the result is calculated and merged in with the rest of the query result (if a `read` function can't be found, Apollo Client will check the cache for a matching field - see [Local data query flow](#local-data-query-flow) for more details).

In the above example we defined and associated a `isInCart` `read` function with the `Launch` GraphQL object type. Let's look at the `isInCart` `read` function more closely:

```js
Launch: {
  fields: {
    isInCart: {
      read(_, { variables }) {
        return localStorage.getItem('CART').includes(
          variables.launchId
        );
      }
    }
  }
}
```

The first parameter of the `isInCart` `read` function gives us access to a previously stored `isInCart` field value from the cache, if one exists. Since we don't need to look at the cache in this example, we've named this parameter `_`. The second parameter is an object that gives us access to several read function properties and helper functions, which are explained in the [`FieldPolicy` API reference](../caching/cache-field-behavior/#fieldpolicy-api-reference). In our case we're only interested in using the `launchId` variable passed into the query, so we'll pull this out of the `variables` property. Using the `launchId` we check to see if our `localStorage` based cart array contains the specified launch, returning `true` / `false` accordingly. The returned boolean is then incorporated back into the result of running the original query, making it look like the value of `isInCart` came back alongside the rest of the server returned data.

Just like resolvers on the server, field policies are extremely flexible. They can be used to perform any kind of local computation you want, before returning a result for the specified field. You can manually query (or write to) the cache in different ways, call other helper utilities or libraries to prepare/validate/clean data, track statistics, call into other data stores to prepare a result, and so much more.

#### Using reactive variables to track `@client` state

TODO

#### Integrating `@client` into remote queries

While Apollo Client’s local state handling features can be used to work with local state exclusively, most Apollo based applications are built to work with remote data sources. To address this, Apollo Client supports mixing `@client` fields (calculated by field policies) with remote queries, as well as using `@client` based fields as arguments to remote queries, in the same request.

The `@client` directive can be used on any GraphQL selection set or field, to identify that the result of that field should be calculated locally with the help of a field policy:

```js
import { ApolloClient, InMemoryCache, gql } from '@apollo/client';

const MEMBER_DETAILS = gql`
  query Member {
    member {
      name
      role
      isLoggedIn @client
    }
  }
`;

const client = new ApolloClient({
  uri: 'http://localhost:4000/graphql',
  cache: new InMemoryCache({
    typePolicies: {
      Member: {
        fields: {
          isLoggedIn: {
            read() {
              return someInternalLoginVerificationFunction();
            }
          }
        }
      }
    }
  })
});

// ... run the query using client.query, a useQuery hook, etc.
```

When the above `MEMBER_DETAILS` query is fired by Apollo Client (assuming we're talking to a network based GraphQL API), the `@client` `isLoggedIn` field is first stripped from the document, and the remaining query is sent over the network to the GraphQL API. After the query has been handled by the remote resolvers and the result is passed back to Apollo Client from the API, the `@client` parts of the original query are then run against any defined cache field policies, their results are merged with the network results, and the final resulting data is returned as the response to the original operation. So in the above example, `isLoggedIn` is stripped before the rest of the query is sent and handled by the network API, then when the results come back `isLoggedIn` is calculated by running the `isLoggedIn` field policy `read` function. Local and network results are merged together, and the final response is made available to the application.

The `@client` directive can be used with entire selection sets as well:

```js
import { ApolloClient, InMemoryCache, gql } from '@apollo/client';

const MEMBER_DETAILS = gql`
  query Member {
    member {
      name
      role
      session @client {
        isLoggedIn
        connectionCount
        errors
      }
    }
  }
`;

const client = new ApolloClient({
  uri: 'http://localhost:4000/graphql',
  cache: new InMemoryCache({
    typePolicies: {
      Member: {
        fields: {
          session: {
            read() {
              return {
                isLoggedIn: someInternalLoginVerificationFunction(),
                connectionCount: calculateOpenConnections(),
                errors: sessionError(),
                __typename: 'Session',
              };
            }
          }
        }
      }
    }
  })
});
```

Apollo Client supports the merging of local `@client` results and remote results for Queries, Mutations and Subscriptions.

### Handling `@client` fields with the cache

As outlined in [Handling `@client` fields with field policies](#handling-client-fields-with-field-policies), `@client` fields can be resolved with the help of field policy functions. However, it's important to note that field policies are not always required when using the `@client` directive. Fields marked with `@client` can still be resolved locally, by pulling matching values out of the cache directly. For example:

```jsx
import React from 'react';
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom';
import {
  ApolloClient,
  InMemoryCache,
  ApolloProvider,
  useQuery,
  gql
} from '@apollo/client';

import Pages from './pages';
import Login from './pages/login';

const client = new ApolloClient({
  uri: 'http://localhost:4000/graphql',
  cache: new InMemoryCache(),
});

const IS_LOGGED_IN = gql`
  query IsUserLoggedIn {
    isLoggedIn @client
  }
`;

cache.writeQuery({
  query: IS_LOGGED_IN,
  data: {
    isLoggedIn: !!localStorage.getItem("token"),
  },
});

function App() {
  const { data } = useQuery(IS_LOGGED_IN);
  return data.isLoggedIn ? <Pages /> : <Login />;
}

ReactDOM.render(
  <ApolloProvider client={client}>
    <App />
  </ApolloProvider>,
  document.getElementById("root"),
);
```

In the above example, we first prepare the cache using `cache.writeQuery` to store a value for the `isLoggedIn` field. We then run the `IS_LOGGED_IN` query via an Apollo Client `useQuery` hook, which includes an `@client` directive. When Apollo Client executes the `IS_LOGGED_IN` query, it first looks for a field policy function that can be used to handle the `@client` field. When it can't find one, it falls back on trying to pull the specified field out of the cache. So in this case, the `data` value returned by the `useQuery` hook has a `isLoggedIn` property available, which includes the `isLoggedIn` result (`!!localStorage.getItem('token')`) pulled directly from the cache.

Pulling `@client` field values directly out of the cache isn't quite as flexible as using field policy functions, since they can perform extra computations before returning a result. Depending on your application's needs however, loading `@client` fields directly from the cache might be a simpler option. Apollo Client doesn't restrict combining both approaches, so feel free to mix and match. If the need arises, you can pull some `@client` values directly from the cache, and calculate others others using field policies, all in the same query.

### Using `@client` fields as variables

Apollo Client provides a way to use an `@client` field result as a variable for a selection set or field, in the same operation. So instead of running an `@client` based query first, getting the local result, then running a second query using the loaded local result as a variable, everything can be handled in one request. This is achieved by combining the `@client` directive with the `@export(as: "variableName")` directive:

```js
import { ApolloClient, InMemoryCache, gql } from '@apollo/client';

const query = gql`
  query CurrentAuthorPostCount($authorId: Int!) {
    currentAuthorId @client @export(as: "authorId")
    postCount(authorId: $authorId)
  }
`;

const client = new ApolloClient({
  uri: 'http://localhost:4000/graphql',
  cache: new InMemoryCache(),
});

cache.writeQuery({
  query: gql`query GetCurrentAuthorId { currentAuthorId }`,
  data: {
    currentAuthorId: 12345,
  },
});

// ... run the query using client.query, useQuery hook, etc.
```

In the example above, `currentAuthorId` is first loaded from the cache, then passed into the subsequent  `postCount` field as the `authorId` variable (specified by the `@export(as: "authorId")` directive). The `@export` directive can also be used on specific fields within a selection set, like:

```js
import { ApolloClient, InMemoryCache, gql } from '@apollo/client';

const query = gql`
  query CurrentAuthorPostCount($authorId: Int!) {
    currentAuthor @client {
      name
      authorId @export(as: "authorId")
    }
    postCount(authorId: $authorId)
  }
`;

const client = new ApolloClient({
  uri: 'http://localhost:4000/graphql',
  cache: new InMemoryCache(),
});

cache.writeQuery({
  query: gql`
    query GetCurrentAuthor {
      currentAuthor {
        name
        authorId
      }
    }
  `,
  data: {
    currentAuthor: {
      __typename: 'Author',
      name: 'John Smith',
      authorId: 12345,
    },
  },
});

// ... run the query using client.query, useQuery hook, etc.
```

Here the `authorId` variable is set from the `authorId` field loaded from the cache stored `currentAuthor`. `@export` variable use isn't limited to remote queries; it can also be used to define variables for other `@client` fields or selection sets:

```js
import { ApolloClient, InMemoryCache, gql } from '@apollo/client';

const query = gql`
  query CurrentAuthorPostCount($authorId: Int!) {
    currentAuthorId @client @export(as: "authorId")
    postCount(authorId: $authorId) @client
  }
`;

const cache = new InMemoryCache({
  typePolicies: {
    Query: {
      fields: {
        postCount: {
          read(_, { variables }) {
            return variables.authorId === 12345 ? 100 : 0;
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
});

const client = new ApolloClient({ cache });

cache.writeQuery({
  query: gql`{ currentAuthorId }`,
  data: {
    currentAuthorId: 12345,
  },
});

// ... run the query using client.query, useQuery hook, etc.
```

So here the `currentAuthorId` is loaded from the cache, then passed into the `postCount` local resolver as `authorId`.

**A few important notes about `@export` use:**

1. Apollo Client currently only supports using the `@export` directive to store variables for local data. `@export` must be used with `@client`.

2. `@client @export` use might appear to go against the GraphQL specification, given that the execution order of an operation looks like it could affect the result. From the [Normal and Serial Execution](https://graphql.github.io/graphql-spec/draft/#sec-Normal-and-Serial-Execution) section of the GraphQL spec:

  > ... the resolution of fields other than top‐level mutation fields must always be side effect‐free and idempotent, the execution order must not affect the result, and hence the server has the freedom to execute the field entries in whatever order it deems optimal.

  Apollo Client currently only supports the use of the `@export` directive when mixed with the `@client` directive. It prepares `@export` variables by first running through an operation that has `@client @export` directives, extracting the specified `@export` variables, then attempting to resolve the value of those variables from the local cache or with field policies. Once a map of variable names to local values is built up, that map is then used to populate the variables passed in when running the server based GraphQL query. The execution order of the server based GraphQL query is not impacted by `@export` use; the variables are prepped and organized before the server query runs, so the specification is being followed.

3. If you define multiple `@export` variables that use the same name, in a single operation, the value of the last `@export` variable will be used as the variable value moving forward. When this happens Apollo Client will log a warning message (dev only).

description: What is Apollo Client?
---

**Apollo Client** is a complete state management library for JavaScript apps. Simply write a GraphQL query, and Apollo Client will take care of requesting and caching your data, as well as updating your UI.

Fetching data with Apollo Client guides you to structure your code in a predictable, declarative way consistent with modern React best practices. With Apollo, you can build high-quality features faster without the hassle of writing data plumbing boilerplate.

## Features

- **Declarative data fetching:** Write a query and receive data without manually tracking loading states
- **Excellent developer experience:** Enjoy helpful tooling for TypeScript, Chrome DevTools, and VS Code
- **Designed for modern React:** Take advantage of the latest React features, such as hooks
- **Incrementally adoptable:** Drop Apollo into any JavaScript app seamlessly
- **Universally compatible:** Use any build setup and any GraphQL API
- **Community driven:** Share knowledge with thousands of developers, thanks to our active open source community

## Get started

Follow the [quick start tutorial](/get-started/) to start fetching data in minutes. For a longer end-to-end example that includes pagination, local state management, and building a graph API, check out the [official Apollo tutorial](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/tutorial/introduction/).

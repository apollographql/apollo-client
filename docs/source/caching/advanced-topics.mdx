This article describes special cases and considerations when using the Apollo Client cache.

## Bypassing the cache

Sometimes you _shouldn't_ use the cache for a particular GraphQL operation. For example, a query's response might be a token that's only used once. In cases like this, use [the `no-cache` fetch policy](../data/queries/#setting-a-fetch-policy):

```js
const { loading, error, data } = useQuery(GET_DOGS, {
  fetchPolicy: "no-cache" // highlight-line
});
```

Operations that use this fetch policy don't write their result to the cache, and they also don't check the cache for data before sending a request to your server. [See all available fetch policies.](../data/queries/#setting-a-fetch-policy)

## Persisting the cache

You can persist and rehydrate the `InMemoryCache` from a storage provider like `AsyncStorage` or `localStorage`. To do so, use the [`apollo3-cache-persist`](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-cache-persist) library. This library works with a variety of [storage providers](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-cache-persist#storage-providers).

To get started, pass your cache and a storage provider to `persistCache`. By default, the contents of your cache are immediately restored asynchronously, and they're persisted on every write to the cache with a short configurable debounce interval.

> Note: The `persistCache` method is async and returns a `Promise`.

```js
import { AsyncStorage } from 'react-native';
import { InMemoryCache } from '@apollo/client';
import { persistCache } from 'apollo3-cache-persist';

const cache = new InMemoryCache();

persistCache({
  cache,
  storage: AsyncStorage,
}).then(() => {
  // Continue setting up Apollo Client as usual.
})
```

For advanced usage and additional configuration options, see the [README of `apollo3-cache-persist`](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-cache-persist).

## Resetting the cache

Sometimes, you might want to reset the cache entirely, such as [when a user logs out](../networking/authentication/#reset-store-on-logout). To accomplish this, call `client.resetStore`. This method is asynchronous, because it also refetches any of your active queries.

```js
export default withApollo(graphql(PROFILE_QUERY, {
  props: ({ data: { loading, currentUser }, ownProps: { client }}) => ({
    loading,
    currentUser,
    resetOnLogout: async () => client.resetStore(),
  }),
})(Profile));
```

> To reset the cache _without_ refetching active queries, use `client.clearStore()` instead of `client.resetStore()`.

### Responding to cache resets

You can register callback functions that execute whenever `client.resetStore` is called. To do so, call `client.onResetStore` and pass in your callback. To register multiple callbacks, call `client.onResetStore` multiple times. All of your callbacks are added to an array and are executed concurrently whenever the cache is reset.

In this example, we use `client.onResetStore` to write default values to the cache. This is useful when using Apollo Client's [local state management](../local-state/local-state-management/) features and calling `client.resetStore` anywhere in your application.

```js
import { ApolloClient, InMemoryCache } from '@apollo/client';
import { withClientState } from 'apollo-link-state';

import { resolvers, defaults } from './resolvers';

const cache = new InMemoryCache();
const stateLink = withClientState({ cache, resolvers, defaults });

const client = new ApolloClient({
  cache,
  link: stateLink,
});

client.onResetStore(stateLink.writeDefaults);
```

You can also call `client.onResetStore` from your React components. This can be useful if you want to force your UI to rerender after the cache is reset.

The `client.onResetStore` method's return value is a function you can call to unregister your callback:

```js{6-8,12}
import { withApollo } from "@apollo/react-hoc";

export class Foo extends Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);
    this.unsubscribe = props.client.onResetStore(
      () => this.setState({ reset: false })
    );
    this.state = { reset: false };
  }
  componentDidUnmount() {
    this.unsubscribe();
  }
  render() {
    return this.state.reset ? <div /> : <span />
  }
}

export default withApollo(Foo);
```


## Refetching queries after a mutation

In certain cases, writing an `update` function to [update the cache after a mutation](../data/mutations/#updating-local-data) can be complex, or even impossible if the mutation doesn't return modified fields.

In these cases, you can provide a `refetchQueries` option to the `useMutation` hook to automatically rerun certain queries after the mutation completes.

For details, see [Refetching queries](../data/mutations/#refetching-queries).

> Note that although `refetchQueries` can be faster to implement than an `update` function, it also requires additional network requests that are usually undesirable. For more information, see [this blog post](https://www.apollographql.com/blog/when-to-use-refetch-queries-in-apollo-client/).

## Incremental loading: `fetchMore`

`fetchMore` can be used to update the result of a query based on the data returned by another query. Most often, it is used to handle infinite-scroll pagination or other situations where you are loading more data when you already have some.

In our GitHunt example, we have a paginated feed that displays a list of GitHub repositories. When we hit the "Load More" button, we don't want Apollo Client to throw away the repository information it has already loaded. Instead, it should just append the newly loaded repositories to the list that Apollo Client already has in the store. With this update, our UI component should re-render and show us all of the available repositories.

Let's see how to do that with the `fetchMore` method on a query:

```javascript
const FEED_QUERY = gql`
  query Feed($type: FeedType!, $offset: Int, $limit: Int) {
    currentUser {
      login
    }
    feed(type: $type, offset: $offset, limit: $limit) {
      id
      # ...
    }
  }
`;

const FeedWithData = ({ match }) => (
  <Query
    query={FEED_QUERY}
    variables={{
      type: match.params.type.toUpperCase() || "TOP",
      offset: 0,
      limit: 10
    }}
    fetchPolicy="cache-and-network"
  >
    {({ data, fetchMore }) => (
      <Feed
        entries={data.feed || []}
        onLoadMore={() =>
          fetchMore({
            variables: {
              offset: data.feed.length
            },
            updateQuery: (prev, { fetchMoreResult }) => {
              if (!fetchMoreResult) return prev;
              return Object.assign({}, prev, {
                feed: [...prev.feed, ...fetchMoreResult.feed]
              });
            }
          })
        }
      />
    )}
  </Query>
);
```


The `fetchMore` method takes a map of `variables` to be sent with the new query. Here, we're setting the offset to `feed.length` so that we fetch items that aren't already displayed on the feed. This variable map is merged with the one that's been specified for the query associated with the component. This means that other variables, e.g. the `limit` variable, will have the same value as they do within the component query.

It can also take a `query` named argument, which can be a GraphQL document containing a query that will be fetched in order to fetch more information; we refer to this as the `fetchMore` query. By default, the `fetchMore` query is the query associated with the container, in this case the `FEED_QUERY`.

When we call `fetchMore`, Apollo Client will fire the `fetchMore` query and use the logic in the `updateQuery` option to incorporate that into the original result. The named argument `updateQuery` should be a function that takes the previous result of the query associated with your component (i.e. `FEED_QUERY` in this case) and the information returned by the `fetchMore` query and return a combination of the two.

Here, the `fetchMore` query is the same as the query associated with the component. Our `updateQuery` takes the new feed items returned and just appends them onto the feed items that we'd asked for previously. With this, the UI will update and the feed will contain the next page of items!

Although `fetchMore` is often used for pagination, there are many other cases in which it is applicable. For example, suppose you have a list of items (say, a collaborative todo list) and you have a way to fetch items that have been updated after a certain time. Then, you don't have to refetch the whole todo list to get updates: you can just incorporate the newly added items with `fetchMore`, as long as your `updateQuery` function correctly merges the new results.

## The `@connection` directive

Fundamentally, paginated queries are the same as any other query with the exception that calls to `fetchMore` update the same cache key. Since these queries are cached by both the initial query and their parameters, a problem arises when later retrieving or updating paginated queries in the cache. We don’t care about pagination arguments such as limits, offsets, or cursors outside of the need to `fetchMore`, nor do we want to provide them simply for accessing cached data.

To solve this Apollo Client 1.6 introduced the `@connection` directive to specify a custom store key for results. A connection allows us to set the cache key for a field and to filter which arguments actually alter the query.

To use the `@connection` directive, simply add the directive to the segment of the query you want a custom store key for and provide the `key` parameter to specify the store key. In addition to the `key` parameter, you can also include the optional `filter` parameter, which takes an array of query argument names to include in the generated custom store key.

```js
const query = gql`
  query Feed($type: FeedType!, $offset: Int, $limit: Int) {
    feed(type: $type, offset: $offset, limit: $limit) @connection(key: "feed", filter: ["type"]) {
      ...FeedEntry
    }
  }
`
```

With the above query, even with multiple `fetchMore`s, the results of each feed update will always result in the `feed` key in the store being updated with the latest accumulated values. In this example, we also use the `@connection` directive's optional `filter` argument to include the `type` query argument in the store key, which results in multiple store values that accumulate queries from each type of feed.

Now that we have a stable store key, we can easily use `writeQuery` to perform a store update, in this case clearing out the feed.

```js
client.writeQuery({
  query: gql`
    query Feed($type: FeedType!) {
      feed(type: $type) @connection(key: "feed", filter: ["type"]) {
        id
      }
    }
  `,
  variables: {
    type: "top",
  },
  data: {
    feed: [],
  },
});
```

Note that because we are only using the `type` argument in the store key, we don't have to provide `offset` or `limit`.

## Cache redirects using field policy `read` functions

> ⚠️ **Note:** Apollo Client >= 3.0 no longer supports the `ApolloClient` `cacheRedirects` constructor option. Equivalent `cacheRedirects` functionality can now be handled with field policy `read` functions, and is explained below.

In some cases, a query requests data that already exists in the cache under a different reference. A very common example of this is when your UI has a list view and a detail view that both use the same data. The list view might run the following query:

```graphql
query Books {
  books {
    id
    title
    abstract
  }
}
```

When a specific book is selected, the detail view displays an individual item using this query:

```graphql
query Book($id: ID!) {
  book(id: $id) {
    id
    title
    abstract
  }
}
```

We know that the data is most likely already in the client cache, but because it was requested with a different query, Apollo Client doesn't know that. To tell Apollo Client where to look for the existing `book` data, we can define a field policy `read` function for the `book` field:

```js
import { ApolloClient, InMemoryCache } from '@apollo/client';

const client = new ApolloClient({
  cache: new InMemoryCache({
    typePolicies: {
      Query: {
        fields: {
          book(_, { args, toReference }) {
            return toReference({
              __typename: 'Book',
              id: args.id,
            });
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
});
```

Now whenever a query includes the `book` field, the `read` function above executes and returns a reference that points to the book entity that was added to the cache when the `Books` list view query ran. Apollo Client uses the reference returned by the `read` function to look up the item in its cache.

The `toReference` helper utility is passed into `read` functions as part of the second parameter options object. It's used to generate an entity reference based on its `__typename` and `id`.

> ⚠️ **Note:** For the above to work properly, the data returned by the list query must include _all_ of the data that the specific detail query needs. If the specific detail query fetches a field that the list query doesn't return, Apollo Client considers the cache hit to be incomplete, and it attempts to fetch the full data set over the network (if network requests are enabled).

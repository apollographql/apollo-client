title: "Using GraphQL directives in Apollo Client"
description: Configure GraphQL fields and fragments
---

A directive decorates part of a GraphQL schema or operation with additional configuration. Tools like Apollo Client can read a GraphQL document's directives and perform custom logic as appropriate.

Directives are preceded by the `@` character, like so:

```graphql
query myQuery($someTest: Boolean) {
  experimentalField @skip(if: $someTest)
}
```

This example shows the `@skip` directive, which is a built-in directive (i.e., it's part of the [GraphQL specification](http://spec.graphql.org/June2018/#sec-Type-System.Directives)). It demonstrates the following about directives:

- Directives can take arguments of their own (`if` in this case).
- Directives appear after the declaration of what they decorate (the `experimentalField` field in this case).

## `@client`

The `@client` directive allows you to resolve client-only data alongside your server data. These fields are not sent to the GraphQL server.

```graphql
query LaunchDetails($launchId: ID!) {
  launch(id: $launchId) {
    site
    rocket {
      type
      # resolved locally on the client,
      # removed from the request to the server
      description @client
    }
  }
}
```

For more information about the `@client` directive, see this section on [local-only fields](/react/local-state/managing-state-with-field-policies/). The `@client` directive is also useful for [client schema mocking](/react/development-testing/client-schema-mocking/#3-query-with-the-client-directive) before a given field is supported in the GraphQL API your application is consuming.

## `@connection`

The `@connection` directive allows you to specify a custom cache key for paginated results. For more information, see this section on the [`@connection` directive](/react/caching/advanced-topics/#the-connection-directive).

```graphql
query Feed($offset: Int, $limit: Int) {
  feed(offset: $offset, limit: $limit) @connection(key: "feed") {
    ...FeedFields
  }
}
```

## `@defer`

Beginning with version `3.7.0`, Apollo Client provides preview support for [the `@defer` directive](https://github.com/graphql/graphql-wg/blob/main/rfcs/DeferStream.md). This directive enables your queries to receive data for specific fields _incrementally_, instead of receiving all field data at the same time. This is helpful whenever some fields in a query take much longer to resolve than others.

To use the `@defer` directive, we apply it to an inline or named fragment that contains all slow-resolving fields:

```graphql
query PersonQuery($personId: ID!) {
  person(id: $personId) {
    # Basic fields (fast)
    id
    firstName
    lastName

    # Friend fields (slower)
    ... @defer {
      friends {
        id
      }
    }
  }
}
```

For more information about the `@defer` directive, check out the [`@defer` docs](/react/data/defer).

## `@export`

If your GraphQL query uses variables, the local-only fields of that query can provide the values of those variables.

To do so, you apply the `@export(as: "variableName")` directive, like so:

```js
const GET_CURRENT_AUTHOR_POST_COUNT = gql`
  query CurrentAuthorPostCount($authorId: Int!) {
    currentAuthorId @client @export(as: "authorId")
    postCount(authorId: $authorId)
  }
`;
```

In the query above, the result of the local-only field `currentAuthorId` is used as the value of the `$authorId` variable that's passed to `postCount`.

You can do this even if `postCount` is also a local-only field (i.e., if it's also marked as `@client`).

For more information and other considerations when using the `@export` directive, check out the [local-only fields docs](/react/local-state/managing-state-with-field-policies/#using-local-only-fields-as-graphql-variables).

## `@nonreactive`

> ⚠️ **The `@nonreactive` directive is currently at the [preview stage](/resources/product-launch-stages/#general-availability) in Apollo Client, and is available by installing `@apollo/client@alpha`.** If you have feedback on it, please let us know via [GitHub issues](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-client/issues/new?assignees=&labels=&template=bug.md).

The `@nonreactive` directive can be used to mark query fields or fragment spreads and is used to indicate that changes to the data contained within the subtrees marked `@nonreactive` should _not_ trigger rerendering. This allows parent components to fetch data to be rendered by their children without rerendering themselves when the data corresponding with fields marked as `@nonreactive` change.

Consider an `App` component that fetches and renders a list of ski trails:

```jsx
const TrailFragment = gql`
  fragment TrailFragment on Trail {
    name
    status
  }
`;

const ALL_TRAILS = gql`
  query allTrails {
    allTrails {
      id
      ...TrailFragment @nonreactive
    }
  }
  ${TrailFragment}
`;

function App() {
  const { data, loading } = useQuery(ALL_TRAILS);
  return (
    <main>
      <h2>Ski Trails</h2>
      <ul>
        {data?.trails.map((trail) => (
          <Trail key={trail.id} id={trail.id} />
        ))}
      </ul>
    </main>
  );
}
```

The `Trail` component renders a trail's name and status and allows the user to execute a mutation to toggle the status of the trail between `"OPEN"` and `"CLOSED"`:

```jsx
const Trail = ({ id }) => {
  const [updateTrail] = useMutation(UPDATE_TRAIL);
  const { data } = useFragment({
    fragment: TrailFragment,
    from: {
      __typename: "Trail",
      id,
    },
  });
  return (
    <li key={id}>
      {data.name} - {data.status}
      <input
        checked={data.status === "OPEN" ? true : false}
        type="checkbox"
        onChange={(e) => {
          updateTrail({
            variables: {
              trailId: id,
              status: e.target.checked ? "OPEN" : "CLOSED",
            },
          });
        }}
      />
    </li>
  );
};
```

Notice that the `Trail` component isn't receiving the entire `trail` object via props, only the `id` which is used along with the fragment document to create a live binding for each trail item in the cache. This allows each `Trail` component to react to the cache updates for a single trail independently. Updates to a trail's `status` will not cause the parent `App` component to rerender since the `@nonreactive` directive is applied to the `TrailFragment` spread, a fragment that includes the `status` field.

## Constructor signature

```ts
constructor(
  options?: RemoveTypenameFromVariablesLink.Options
): RemoveTypenameFromVariablesLink
```

## Use case

As an example, take the following query. Apollo Client automatically adds `__typename` fields for each field selection set.

```ts
const query = gql`
  query DashboardQuery($id: ID!) {
    dashboard(id: $id) {
      id
      name
    }
  }
`;

const { data } = await client.query({ query, variables: { id: 1 } });
// {
//   "dashboard": {
//     "__typename": "Dashboard",
//     "id": 1,
//     "name": "My Dashboard"
//   }
// }
```

Now let's update this dashboard by sending a mutation to our server. We'll use the `dashboard` returned from the previous query as input to our mutation.

```ts
const mutation = gql`
  mutation UpdateDashboardMutation($dashboard: DashboardInput!) {
    updateDashboard(dashboard: $dashboard) {
      id
      name
    }
  }
`;

await client.mutate({
  mutation,
  variables: {
    dashboard: { ...data.dashboard, name: "My Updated Dashboard" },
  },
});
```

Without the use of `RemoveTypenameFromVariablesLink`, the server will return an error because `data.dashboard` still contains the `__typename` field.

## Usage

Include `RemoveTypenameFromVariablesLink` anywhere in your [link chain](./introduction/#composing-a-link-chain) before your [terminating link](./introduction#the-terminating-link)
to remove `__typename` fields from variables for all operations.

```ts
import { ApolloLink } from "@apollo/client";
import { RemoveTypenameFromVariablesLink } from "@apollo/client/link/remove-typename";

const removeTypenameLink = new RemoveTypenameFromVariablesLink();
const link = ApolloLink.from([removeTypenameLink, httpLink]);

const client = new ApolloClient({
  link,
  // ... other options
});
```

If you're using [directional composition](/react/api/link/introduction#directional-composition),
for example, to [send a subscription to a websocket connection](/react/data/subscriptions#3-split-communication-by-operation-recommended),
place `RemoveTypenameFromVariablesLink` before the split link to remove `__typename` from variables for all operations.

```ts
import { OperationTypeNode } from "graphql";
import { ApolloLink } from "@apollo/client";
import { RemoveTypenameFromVariablesLink } from "@apollo/client/link/remove-typename";

const removeTypenameLink = new RemoveTypenameFromVariablesLink();

const splitLink = ApolloLink.split(
  ({ operationType }) => {
    return operationType === OperationTypeNode.SUBSCRIPTION;
  },
  wsLink,
  httpLink
);

const link = ApolloLink.from([removeTypenameLink, splitLink]);

const client = new ApolloClient({
  link,
  // ... other options
});
```

## Keep `__typename` in JSON scalars

You may need to retain the `__typename` field from a query's responseâ€”for example, in the case of [JSON scalar](https://github.com/taion/graphql-type-json) input fields.

While the [GraphQL type validation spec](https://spec.graphql.org/October2021/#sec-Input-Objects.Type-Validation) disallows input fields that begin with two underscores (`__`), this restriction doesn't apply when the input field is a [JSON scalar](https://github.com/taion/graphql-type-json). (A JSON scalar type accepts raw JSON as input.) You can configure `RemoveTypenameFromVariablesLink` link to retain `__typename` for certain `JSON` scalars.

To do so, provide an `except` option when instantiating `RemoveTypenameFromVariablesLink` and use the `KEEP` sentinel to denote which variables types should keep `__typename`. Each key in the `except` option should correspond to an input type in your GraphQL schema.

For example, suppose your schema includes a `ConfigureDashboardMutation` mutation that takes a `JSON` type variable named `$dashboardConfig`:

```graphql
mutation ConfigureDashboardMutation($dashboardConfig: JSON) {
  configureDashboard(config: $dashboardConfig) {
    id
  }
}
```

You tell `RemoveTypenameFromVariablesLink` to keep all `__typename` fields for any variable declared as a `JSON` type with the `KEEP` sentinel. Variable types are inferred from the GraphQL query.

```ts
import {
  RemoveTypenameFromVariablesLink,
  KEEP,
} from "@apollo/client/link/remove-typename";

const removeTypenameLink = new RemoveTypenameFromVariablesLink({
  except: {
    JSON: KEEP,
  },
});
```

When the query moves through `RemoveTypenameFromVariablesLink`, the `dashboardConfig` variable will be detected as a `JSON` scalar type and all `__typename` fields are kept intact.

<Note>

The JSON scalar type does not need to be literally named `JSON` to be considered a JSON scalar.

</Note>

### Nested JSON scalar fields in input variables

Not all top-level variables may map to a JSON scalar type. For more complex input object types, the JSON scalar may be found on a nested field. The `except` option lets you configure nested fields within these types to keep `__typename` intact.

```ts
import {
  RemoveTypenameFromVariablesLink,
  KEEP,
} from "@apollo/client/link/remove-typename";

const removeTypenameLink = new RemoveTypenameFromVariablesLink({
  except: {
    DashboardInput: {
      config: KEEP,
    },
  },
});
```

Variables declared as type `DashboardInput` will have all top-level `__typename` fields removed, but keep `__typename` for the `config` field.

This nesting can be as deep as needed and include as many fields as necessary. Use the `KEEP` sentinel to determine where `__typename` should be kept.

```ts
import {
  RemoveTypenameFromVariablesLink,
  KEEP,
} from "@apollo/client/link/remove-typename";

const removeTypenameLink = new RemoveTypenameFromVariablesLink({
  except: {
    // Keep __typename for `bar` and `baz` fields on any variable
    // declared as a `FooInput` type
    FooInput: {
      bar: KEEP,
      baz: KEEP,
    },

    // Keep __typename for the `baz.qux` field on any variable
    // declared as a `BarInput` type
    BarInput: {
      baz: {
        qux: KEEP,
      },
    },

    // Keep __typename on `bar.baz` and `bar.qux.foo` fields for any
    // variable declared as a `BazInput` type
    BazInput: {
      bar: {
        baz: KEEP,
        qux: {
          foo: KEEP,
        },
      },
    },
  },
});
```

To keep `__typename` for nested fields in arrays, use the same object notation as if the field were an object type.

```ts
import {
  RemoveTypenameFromVariablesLink,
  KEEP,
} from "@apollo/client/link/remove-typename";

const removeTypenameLink = new RemoveTypenameFromVariablesLink({
  except: {
    // Keep __typename on the `config` field for each widget
    // in the `widgets` array for variables declared as
    // a `DashboardInput` type
    DashboardInput: {
      widgets: {
        config: KEEP,
      },
    },
  },
});
```

`GraphQLWsLink` requires the [`graphql-ws`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/graphql-ws) library. Install it in your project like so:

```shell
npm install graphql-ws
```

<DocBlock
  canonicalReference="@apollo/client/link/subscriptions!GraphQLWsLink:class"
  customOrder={["example"]}
/>

## Constructor signature

{/* TODO: Remove the custom signature once documentation supports rendering constructor functions */}

```js
constructor(
  client: Client
): GraphQLWsLink
```

### Options

The `GraphQLWsLink` constructor takes a single argument, which is a `Client` returned from the `graphql-ws` `createClient` function.

The `createClient` function can take many options, described in the [`graphql-ws` docs for `ClientOptions`](https://the-guild.dev/graphql/ws/docs/client/interfaces/ClientOptions). The one required option is `url`, which is the URL (typically starting with `ws://` or `wss://`, which are the equivalents of `http://` and `https://` respectively) to your WebSocket server. (Note that this differs from the [older link's URL option](./apollo-link-ws), which is named `uri` instead of `url`.)

## Usage

See [Subscriptions](../../data/subscriptions/) for more information on using subscription operations in Apollo Client.

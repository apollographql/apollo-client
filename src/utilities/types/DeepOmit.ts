// Unfortunately there is one major flaw in this type: This will omit properties

// ignores class instances, therefore resulting in a type mismatch between

// It is not currently possible with TypeScript to distinguish between plain
// objects and class instances.
// https://github.com/microsoft/TypeScript/issues/29063
//
// This should be fine as of the time of this writing until omitDeep gets
// broader use since this utility is only used to strip __typename from
// `variables`; a case in which class instances are invalid anyways.

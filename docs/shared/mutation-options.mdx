| Option | Type | Description |
| - | - | - |
| `mutation` | DocumentNode | A GraphQL mutation document parsed into an AST by `graphql-tag`. **Optional** for the `useMutation` Hook since the mutation can be passed in as the first parameter to the Hook. **Required** for the `Mutation` component. |
| `variables` | { [key: string]: any } | An object containing all of the variables your mutation needs to execute |
| `update` | (cache: ApolloCache, mutationResult: FetchResult) | A function used to update the cache after a mutation occurs |
| `ignoreResults`| boolean | If true, the returned `data` property will not update with the mutation result. |
| `optimisticResponse` | Object | Provide a [mutation response](/performance/optimistic-ui/) before the result comes back from the server |
| `refetchQueries` | Array&lt;string\|{ query: DocumentNode, variables?: TVariables}&gt; \| ((mutationResult: FetchResult) => Array&lt;string\|{ query: DocumentNode, variables?: TVariables}&gt;) | An array or function that allows you to specify which queries you want to refetch after a mutation has occurred. Array values can either be queries (with optional variables) or just the string names of queries to be refetched. |
| `awaitRefetchQueries` | boolean | Queries refetched as part of `refetchQueries` are handled asynchronously, and are not waited on before the mutation is completed (resolved). Setting this to `true` will make sure refetched queries are completed before the mutation is considered done. `false` by default. |
| `onCompleted` | (data: TData) => void | A callback executed once your mutation successfully completes |
| `onError` | (error: ApolloError) => void | A callback executed in the event of an error. |
| `errorPolicy` | ErrorPolicy | How you want your component to handle network and GraphQL errors. Defaults to "none", which means we treat GraphQL errors as runtime errors. |
| `context` | Record&lt;string, any&gt; | Shared context between your component and your network interface (Apollo Link). |
| `client` | ApolloClient | An `ApolloClient` instance. By default `useMutation` / `Mutation` uses the client passed down via context, but a different client can be passed in. |

Ship React Compiler compiled React hooks in `@apollo/client/react/compiled`.

We now ship a React-Compiler compiled version of the React hooks in
`@apollo/client/react/compiled`.

This entry point contains everything that `@apollo/client/react` does,
so you can use it as a drop-in replacement in your whole application
if you choose to use the compiled hooks.

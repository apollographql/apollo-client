## `skipToken`

While not a hook by itself, `skipToken` is designed to be used with `useSuspenseQuery` and `useBackgroundQuery`.
If a `skipToken` is passed into one of those hooks instead of the `options` object, that hook will not cause any requests or suspenseful behavior, while keeping the last `data` available.

```js title="Recommended usage of skipToken with useSuspenseQuery"
import { skipToken, useSuspenseQuery } from '@apollo/client/react';
const { data } = useSuspenseQuery(
  query,
  id ? { variables: { id } } : skipToken
);
```


```js title="Recommended usage of skipToken with useBackgroundQuery"
import { skipToken, useBackgroundQuery } from '@apollo/client/react';
const [queryRef] = useBackgroundQuery(
  query,
  id ? { variables: { id } } : skipToken
);
```

Note: **Why do we recommend `skipToken` over `{ skip: true }`?**

Imagine this very common scenario for `skip`: You want to skip your query if a certain variable is not set. You might be tempted to write something like this:

```ts
const { data } = useSuspenseQuery(query, {
  variables: { id },
  skip: !id
});
```
But in that case, TypeScript will complain:
```
Type 'number | undefined' is not assignable to type 'number'.
      Type 'undefined' is not assignable to type 'number'.ts(2769)
```

To get around that, you have to tell TypeScript to ignore the fact that `id` could be `undefined`:
```ts
const { data } = useSuspenseQuery(query, {
  variables: { id: id! },
  skip: !id
});
```
Alternatively, you could also use some obscure default value:
```ts
const { data } = useSuspenseQuery(query, {
  variables: { id: id || 0 },
  skip: !id
});
```

What both of these solutions have in common: They hide a potential bug. If your `skip` logic becomes more complex in the future, you might accidentally introduce a bug that causes your query not to be skipped, even though `id` is still `undefined` - and TypeScript won't be able to warn you about it.

So instead, we recommend using `skipToken`, as that will work without a lie to the compiler or an obscure default value:

```ts
const { data } = useSuspenseQuery(
  query,
  id ? { variables: { id } } : skipToken
);
```
In this case, it becomes apparent for TypeScript that there is a direct connection between skipping and the `variables` option - and it will work without unsafe workarounds.

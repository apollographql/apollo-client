title: Remove Typename Link
description: Automatically remove __typename fields from variables.
minVersion: 3.8.0

## Overview

The `removeTypenameFromVariables` link automatically removes `__typename` fields from variables in operations. This is useful when reusing data from a query as an argument to another GraphQL operation.

```ts
import { removeTypenameFromVariables } from '@apollo/client/link/remove-typename';

const removeTypenameLink = removeTypenameFromVariables();
```

As an example, let's take the following query. Apollo Client will automatically add `__typename` fields to the query for each field selection set.

```ts
const query = gql`
  query DashboardQuery($id: ID!) {
    dashboard(id: $id) {
      id
      name
    }
  }
`;

const { data } = await client.query({ query, variables: { id: 1 }});
// {
//   "dashboard": {
//     "__typename": "Dashboard",
//     "id": 1,
//     "name": "My Dashboard"
//   }
// }
```

Now let's update this dashboard by sending a mutation to our server. We'll use the `dashboard` as input to our mutation.

```ts
const mutation = gql`
  mutation UpdateDashboardMutation($dashboard: DashboardInput!) {
    updateDashboard(dashboard: $dashboard) {
      id
      name
    }
  }
`;

await client.mutate({ 
  mutation,
  variables: { 
    dashboard: { ...data.dashboard, name: 'My Updated Dashboard' } 
  }
});
```

Without the use of the `removeTypenameFromVariables` link, the server will return an error because `data.dashboard` still contains the `__typename` field.

## Keep `__typename` in JSON scalars

While the [GraphQL spec](https://spec.graphql.org/October2021/#sec-Input-Objects.Type-Validation) disallows input fields that begin with the characters "\_\_" (two underscores), this restriction is not applied when the input field is a JSON scalar (i.e. a scalar type that accepts raw JSON as input). When your server relies on `__typename` within certain `JSON` scalars, you can configure the `removeTypenameFromVariables` link to retain `__typename`.

> Note: the JSON scalar type does not need to be literally named `JSON` to be considered a JSON scalar.

Provide an `except` option to map all variable types that should maintain `__typename`. This is done using the `KEEP` sentinel. Each key in the `except` option should correspond to an input type in your GraphQL schema.

Here we tell the `removeTypenameFromVariables` link to keep all `__typename` fields for any variable that is declared as a `JSON` type. Variable types are inferred from the GraphQL query. Let's take the following GraphQL mutation:

```graphql
mutation ConfigureDashboardMutation($dashboardConfig: JSON) {
  configureDashboard(config: $dashboardConfig) {
    id
  }
}
```

```ts
import { removeTypenameFromVariables, KEEP } from '@apollo/client/link/remove-typename';

const removeTypenameLink = removeTypenameFromVariables({
  except: {
    JSON: KEEP
  }
});
```

Here we've declared a `dashboardConfig` variable as type `JSON`. When the query moves through the `removeTypenameFromVariables` link, the `dashboardConfig` variable will be detected as a `JSON` scalar type and all `__typename` fields are kept intact.

### Nested JSON scalar fields in input variables

Not all top-level variables may map to a JSON scalar type. For more complex input object types, the JSON scalar may be found on a nested field. The `except` option allows you to configured nested fields within these types to keep `__typename` intact for these fields.

```ts
import { removeTypenameFromVariables, KEEP } from '@apollo/client/link/remove-typename';

const removeTypenameLink = removeTypenameFromVariables({
  except: {
    DashboardInput: {
      config: KEEP
    }
  }
});
```

Variables declared as type `DashboardInput` will have any top-level `__typename` fields removed, but keep `__typename` for the `config` field.

This nesting can be as deep as needed and include as many fields as necessary. Use the `KEEP` sentinel to determine where `__typename` should be kept.

```ts
import { removeTypenameFromVariables, KEEP } from '@apollo/client/link/remove-typename';

const removeTypenameLink = removeTypenameFromVariables({
  except: {
    // Keep __typename for `bar` and `baz` fields on any variable 
    // declared as a `FooInput` type
    FooInput: {
      bar: KEEP,
      baz: KEEP,
    },

    // Keep __typename for the `baz.qux` field on any variable 
    // declared as a `BarInput` type
    BarInput: {
      baz: {
        qux: KEEP
      }
    },

    // Keep __typename on `bar.baz` and `bar.qux.foo` fields for any 
    // variable declared as a `BazInput` type
    BazInput: {
      bar: {
        baz: KEEP, 
        qux: {
          foo: KEEP
        }
      }
    },
  }
});
```

To keep `__typename` for nested fields in arrays, use the same object notation as if the field were an object type.

```ts
import { removeTypenameFromVariables, KEEP } from '@apollo/client/link/remove-typename';

const removeTypenameLink = removeTypenameFromVariables({
  except: {
    // Keep __typename on the `config` field for each widget 
    // in the `widgets` array for variables declared as 
    // a `DashboardInput` type
    DashboardInput: {
      widgets: {
        config: KEEP
      }
    }
  }
});
```

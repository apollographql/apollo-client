title: '@defer support'
description: The @defer directive and Apollo Client
---

> ⚠️ **Defer is a [Stage 1 GraphQL specification proposal](https://github.com/graphql/graphql-spec/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md#stage-1-proposal).** Before it reaches acceptance, it might still change in backward incompatible ways. If you have feedback on it, please let us know via [GitHub issues](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-client/issues/new?assignees=&labels=&template=bug.md)

Beginning with version REPLACE_ME, Apollo Web Client provides beta support for [the `@defer` directive](https://github.com/graphql/graphql-wg/blob/main/rfcs/DeferStream.md), which enables your queries to receive data for specific fields asynchronously. This is helpful whenever some fields in a query take much longer to resolve than the others.

For example, let's say we're building a social media application that can quickly fetch a user's basic profile information, but retrieving that user's friends takes longer. If we include _all_ of those fields in a single query, we want to be able to display the profile information as soon as it's available, instead of waiting for the friend fields to resolve.

Applying the `@defer` directive to the fragment selecting the friends fields indicates that we are ready to receive them later, asynchronously:

```graphql
query PersonQuery($personId: ID!) {
  person(id: $personId) {
    # Basic fields (fast)
    id
    firstName
    lastName

    # Friends (slow)
    ... on User @defer {
      friends {
        id
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## Code Generation

If you currently use [GraphQL Code Generator](https://www.the-guild.dev/graphql/codegen) for your CodeGen needs, be advised it doesn't yet support the use of the `@defer` directive in the code output.

You can refer to this [issue](https://github.com/dotansimha/graphql-code-generator/issues/7885) in the Github project for reference.

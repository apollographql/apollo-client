## `skipToken`

`skipToken` provides a type-safe mechanism to skip query execution. It is currently supported with `useSuspenseQuery` and `useBackgroundQuery`.
When you pass a `skipToken` to one of the supported hooks instead of the `options` object, the hook will not cause any requests or suspenseful behavior and keeps the last `data` available. It is typically used conditionally to start query execution when the input data is available.

```js title="Recommended usage of skipToken with useSuspenseQuery"
import { skipToken, useSuspenseQuery } from '@apollo/client/react';
const { data } = useSuspenseQuery(
  query,
  id ? { variables: { id } } : skipToken
);
```


```js title="Recommended usage of skipToken with useBackgroundQuery"
import { skipToken, useBackgroundQuery } from '@apollo/client/react';
const [queryRef] = useBackgroundQuery(
  query,
  id ? { variables: { id } } : skipToken
);
```

Note: **Why do we recommend `skipToken` over `{ skip: true }`?**

Imagine this very common scenario for `skip`: You want to skip your query if a certain required variable is not set. You might be tempted to write something like this:

```ts
const { data } = useSuspenseQuery(query, {
  variables: { id },
  skip: !id
});
```
But in that case, TypeScript will complain:
```
Type 'number | undefined' is not assignable to type 'number'.
      Type 'undefined' is not assignable to type 'number'.ts(2769)
```

To get around that, you have to tell TypeScript to ignore the fact that `id` could be `undefined`:
```ts
const { data } = useSuspenseQuery(query, {
  variables: { id: id! },
  skip: !id
});
```
Alternatively, you could also use some obscure default value:
```ts
const { data } = useSuspenseQuery(query, {
  variables: { id: id || 0 },
  skip: !id
});
```

Both of these solutions hide a potential bug. If your `skip` logic becomes more complex, you might accidentally introduce a bug that causes your query to execute, even when `id` is still `undefined`. In that case, TypeScript cannot warn you about it.

Instead we recommend using `skipToken`. It provides type safety without the need for an obscure default value:

```ts
const { data } = useSuspenseQuery(
  query,
  id ? { variables: { id } } : skipToken
);
```
Here it becomes apparent for TypeScript that there is a direct connection between skipping and the `variables` option - and it will work without unsafe workarounds.

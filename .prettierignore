##### DISCLAIMER ######
# We have disabled the use of prettier in this project for a variety of reasons.
# Because much of this project has not been formatted, we don't want to want to
# apply formatting to everything and skew `git blame` stats. Instead, we should
# only format newly created files that we can guarantee have no existing git
# history. For this reason, we have disabled prettier project-wide except for
# a handful of files.
#
# ONLY ADD NEWLY CREATED FILES/PATHS TO THE LIST BELOW. DO NOT ADD EXISTING
# PROJECT FILES.

# Ignore all mdx & md files:
*.har
*.snap

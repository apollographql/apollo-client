| `shouldResubscribe` | boolean | Determines if your subscription should be unsubscribed and subscribed again |
| `onSubscriptionData` | (options: OnSubscriptionDataOptions&lt;TData&gt;) => any | Allows the registration of a callback function, that will be triggered each time the `useSubscription` Hook / `Subscription` component receives data. The callback `options` object param consists of the current Apollo Client instance in `client`, and the received subscription data in `subscriptionData`. |
| `fetchPolicy` | FetchPolicy | How you want your component to interact with the Apollo cache. For details, see [Setting a fetch policy](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/react/data/queries/#setting-a-fetch-policy). |

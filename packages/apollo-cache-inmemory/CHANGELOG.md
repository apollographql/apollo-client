### 1.1.2

- Ensure that heuristics warnings do not fire in production
  [PR #2611](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-client/pull/2611)

### 1.1.1

- Change some access modifiers "private" to "protected" to allow code reuse by
  InMemoryCache subclasses.
- Improved rollup builds

### 1.1.0

- Improve errors for id mismatch when writing to the store
- Make it possible to swap the cache implementation. For example, you might
  want to use a `Map` to store the normalized objects, which can be faster
  than writing by keys to an `Object`. This also allows for custom use cases,
  such as emitting events on `.set()` or `.delete()` (think Observables),
  which was otherwise impossible without the use of Proxies, that are only
  available in some browsers. Unless you passed in the `store` to one of the
  `apollo-cache-inmemory` functions, such as: `writeQueryToStore` or
  `writeResultToStore`, no changes to your code are necessary. If you did
  access the cache's functions directly, all you need to do is add a
  `.toObject()` call on the cache â€” review the changes to the tests for [an example](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-client/blob/cd563bcd1c2c15b973d0cdfd63332f5ee82da309/packages/apollo-cache-inmemory/src/__tests__/writeToStore.ts#L258).
  For reasoning behind this change and more information, see
  [Issue #2293](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-client/issues/2293).

  [PR #2358](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-client/pull/2358)

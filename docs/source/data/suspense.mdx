description: Using React 18 Suspense features with Apollo Client
minVersion: 3.8.0
---

"Suspense" is both a specific React API ([`<Suspense />`](https://react.dev/reference/react/Suspense), a component which "lets you display a fallback until its children have finished loading"), and often used more generally to refer to a new way to build React apps using the [**concurrent rendering engine**](https://react.dev/blog/2022/03/29/react-v18#what-is-concurrent-react) introduced in React 18.

In this guide, we'll look at Apollo Client's data fetching hooks introduced in 3.8 which leverage React's powerful Suspense features and walk through some examples of how they can be used.

> To follow along with the examples below, open up our [Suspense demo](https://codesandbox.io/s/github/apollographql/docs-examples/tree/main/apollo-client/v3/suspense-hooks?file=/src/App.tsx) on CodeSandbox.

## Fetching with Suspense

`useSuspenseQuery` initiates a network request and causes the component calling it to suspend while the request is made. It can be thought of as a Suspense-ready replacement for `useQuery` that allows you to take advantage of React's Suspense features while fetching during render.

Let's take a look at an example:

```tsx {5,38,40,45-47}
import { Suspense } from 'react';
import {
  gql,
  TypedDocumentNode,
  useSuspenseQuery
} from '@apollo/client';

interface Data {
  dog: {
    id: string;
    name: string;
  };
}

interface Variables {
  id: string;
}

interface DogProps {
  id: string
}

const GET_DOG_QUERY: TypedDocumentNode<Data, Variables> = gql`
  query GetDog($id: String) {
    dog(id: $id) {
      # By default, an object's cache key is a combination of
      # its __typename and id fields, so we should always make
      # sure the id is in the response so our data can be
      # properly cached.
      id
      name
    }
  }
`;

function App() {
  return (
    <Suspense fallback={<div>Loading...</div>}>
      <Dog id="3" />
    </Suspense>
  );
}

function Dog({ id }: DogProps) {
  const { data } = useSuspenseQuery(GET_DOG_QUERY, {
    variables: { id },
  });

  return <>Name: {data.dog.name}</>;
}
```

> **Note:** this example manually defines TypeScript interfaces for `Data` and `Variables` as well as the type for `GET_DOG_QUERY` using `TypedDocumentNode`. [GraphQL Code Generator](https://www.the-guild.dev/graphql/codegen) is a popular tool that will create these type definitions automatically for you. See the reference on [Using TypeScript](../development-testing/static-typing) for more information on integrating GraphQL Code Generator with Apollo Client.

In this example, our `App` component renders a `Dog` component which fetches the record for a single dog via `useSuspenseQuery`. When React attempts to render `Dog` for the first time, the cache is unable to fulfill the request for the `GetDog` query, so `useSuspenseQuery` initiates a network request. `Dog` suspends while the network request is pending, triggering the nearest `Suspense` boundary _above_ the suspended component in `App` which renders our "Loading..." fallback. Once the network request is complete, `Dog` renders with the newly cached `name` for Mozzarella the Corgi.

You may have noticed that `useSuspenseQuery` does not return a `loading` boolean: this is because the component calling `useSuspenseQuery` will always suspend when fetching data. A corollary is that when it _does_ render, `data` is always defined! Suspense fallbacks that exist **outside of suspended components** take the place of loading states that components were responsible for rendering themselves in the previous React paradigm.

> **Note for TypeScript users**: since `GET_DOG_QUERY` is a `TypedDocumentNode` in which we have specified the result type via `Data` generic type argument, the TypeScript type for `data` returned by `useSuspenseQuery` reflects that! This means that `data` is guaranteed to be defined when `Dog` renders, and that `data.dog` will have the shape `{ id: string; name: string; breed: string; }`.

### Changing variables

In the previous example, we fetched the record for a single dog by passing a hard-coded `id` variable, Mozzarella, to `useSuspenseQuery`. Now, let's say we want to fetch the record for a different dog using a dynamic value. We'll fetch the list of dogs with just their `name` and `id`, and once the user selects an individual dog we fetch more details, including their `breed`.

Let's update our example:

```tsx {28-30,35,42,49-51}
export const GET_DOG_QUERY: TypedDocumentNode<
  DogData,
  Variables
> = gql`
  query GetDog($id: String) {
    dog(id: $id) {
      id
      name
      breed
    }
  }
`;

export const GET_DOGS_QUERY: TypedDocumentNode<
  DogsData,
  Variables
> = gql`
  query GetDogs {
    dogs {
      id
      name
    }
  }
`;

function App() {
  const { data } = useSuspenseQuery(GET_DOGS_QUERY);
  const [selectedDog, setSelectedDog] = useState(
    data.dogs[0].id
  );

  return (
    <>
      <select
        onChange={(e) => setSelectedDog(e.target.value)}
      >
        {data.dogs.map(({ id, name }) => (
          <option key={id} value={id}>{dog.name}</option>
        ))}
      </select>
      <Suspense fallback={<div>Loading...</div>}>
        <Dog id={selectedDog} />
      </Suspense>
    </>
  );
}

function Dog({ id }: DogProps) {
  const { data } = useSuspenseQuery(GET_DOG_QUERY, {
    variables: { id },
  });

  return (
    <>
      <div>Name: {data.dog.name}</div>
      <div>Breed: {data.dog.breed}</div>
    </>
  );
}
```

Changing the dog via the `select` will cause the component to suspend each time we select a dog whose record **does not yet exist in the cache**. Once we've loaded a given dog's record in the cache, however, selecting that dog again from our dropdown will not cause the component to re-suspend, since under our default `cache-first` fetch policy Apollo Client will not make a network request after a cache hit.

### Updating state without suspending

Sometimes we may want to avoid showing a loading UI in response to a pending network request and instead prefer to continue displaying the previous render. To do this, we can use a [_transition_](https://react.dev/blog/2022/03/29/react-v18#new-feature-transitions) to mark our update as non-urgent. This tells React to keep the existing UI in place until the new data has finished loading.

To mark a state update as a transition, we use the [`startTransition`](https://react.dev/reference/react/startTransition) function from React.

Let's modify our example so that the previously displayed dog remains on the screen while the next one is fetched in a transition:

```tsx {1,13-15}
import { useState, Suspense, startTransition } from "react";

function App() {
  const { data } = useSuspenseQuery(GET_DOGS_QUERY);
  const [selectedDog, setSelectedDog] = useState(
    data.dogs[0].id
  );

  return (
    <>
      <select
        onChange={(e) => {
          startTransition(() => {
            setSelectedDog(e.target.value);
          });
        }}
      >
        {data.dogs.map(({ id, name }) => (
          <option key={id} value={id}>{name}</option>
        ))}
      </select>
      <Suspense fallback={<div>Loading...</div>}>
        <Dog id={selectedDog} />
      </Suspense>
    </>
  );
}
```

By wrapping our `setSelectedDog` state update in React's `startTransition` function, we no longer see the Suspense fallback when selecting a new dog! Instead, the previous dog remains on the screen until the next dog's record has finished loading.

### Showing pending UI during a transition

In the previous example, there is no visual indication that a fetch is happening when a new dog is selected. To provide nice visual feedback, let's update our example to use React's [`useTransition`](https://react.dev/reference/react/useTransition) hook which gives you an `isPending` boolean value to determine when a transition is happening.

Let's dim the select dropdown while the transition is happening:

```tsx {1,4,13}
import { useState, Suspense, useTransition } from "react";

function App() {
  const [isPending, startTransition] = useTransition();
  const { data } = useSuspenseQuery(GET_DOGS_QUERY);
  const [selectedDog, setSelectedDog] = useState(
    data.dogs[0].id
  );

  return (
    <>
      <select
        style={{ opacity: isPending ? 0.5 : 1 }}
        onChange={(e) => {
          startTransition(() => {
            setSelectedDog(e.target.value);
          });
        }}
      >
        {data.dogs.map(({ id, name }) => (
          <option key={id} value={id}>{name}</option>
        ))}
      </select>
      <Suspense fallback={<div>Loading...</div>}>
        <Dog id={selectedDog} />
      </Suspense>
    </>
  );
}
```

### Rendering partial data

When the cache contains partial data, you may prefer to render that data immediately without suspending. To do this, use the `returnPartialData` option.

> **Note:** this option only works when combined with either the `cache-first` (default) or `cache-and-network` fetch policy. `cache-only` is not currently supported by `useSuspenseQuery`. For details on these fetch policies, see [Setting a fetch policy](/react/data/queries/#setting-a-fetch-policy).

Let's update our example to use the partial cache data and render immediately:

```tsx {41}
interface PartialData {
  dog: {
    id: string;
    name: string;
  };
}

const PARTIAL_GET_DOG_QUERY: TypedDocumentNode<
  PartialData,
  Variables
> = gql`
  query GetDog($id: String) {
    dog(id: $id) {
      id
      name
    }
  }
`;

// Write partial data for Buck to the cache
// so it is available when Dog renders
client.writeQuery({
  query: GET_DOG_QUERY_PARTIAL,
  variables: { id: "1" },
  data: { dog: { id: "1", name: "Buck" } },
});

function App() {
  const client = useApolloClient();

  return (
    <Suspense fallback={<div>Loading...</div>}>
      <Dog id="1" />
    </Suspense>
  );
}

function Dog({ id }: DogProps) {
  const { data } = useSuspenseQuery(GET_DOG_QUERY, {
    variables: { id },
    returnPartialData: true,
  });

  return (
    <>
      <div>Name: {data?.dog?.name}</div>
      <div>Breed: {data?.dog?.breed}</div>
    </>
  );
}
```

In this example, we write partial data to the cache for Buck to show the behavior when a query cannot be fully fulfilled from the cache. We tell `useSuspenseQuery` that we are ok rendering partial data by setting the `returnPartialData` option to `true`. When `Dog` renders for the first time, it does not suspend and uses the partial data immediately. Apollo Client will fetch the missing query data from the network in the background.

You will see Buck's name displayed immediately after the `Name` label, followed by the `Breed` label with no value. Once the missing fields have loaded, `useSuspenseQuery` will update and Buck's breed will be displayed.

> **Note for TypeScript users**: with `returnPartialData` set to `true`, the returned type for the `data` property will mark all fields in the query type as [optional](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/2/objects.html#optional-properties). Apollo Client cannot accurately determine which fields are present in the cache at any given time when returning partial data.

### Error handling

By default, both network errors and GraphQL errors are thrown by `useSuspenseQuery`. These errors will be caught and displayed by the closest [error boundary](https://react.dev/reference/react/Component#static-getderivedstatefromerror).

> **Note:** An error boundary is a **class component** that implements `static getDerivedStateFromError`. For more information, see the React docs for [catching rendering errors with an error boundary](https://react.dev/reference/react/Component#catching-rendering-errors-with-an-error-boundary).

Let's create a basic error boundary that renders an error UI when errors are thrown by our query:

```tsx
class ErrorBoundary extends React.Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);
    this.state = { hasError: false };
  }

  static getDerivedStateFromError(error) {
    return { hasError: true };
  }

  render() {
    if (this.state.hasError) {
      return this.props.fallback;
    }

    return this.props.children;
  }
}
```

> **Note:** In a real application, your error boundary might need a more robust implementation. Consider using a library like [`react-error-boundary`](https://github.com/bvaughn/react-error-boundary) when you need a high degree of flexibility and reusability.

When the `GET_DOG_QUERY` inside of the `Dog` component returns a GraphQL error or a network error, `useSuspenseQuery` throws the error and the nearest error boundary renders its fallback component.

Our example doesn't have an error boundary yet—let's add one!

```tsx {18-20,24}
function App() {
  const { data } = useSuspenseQuery(GET_DOGS_QUERY);
  const [selectedDog, setSelectedDog] = useState(
    data.dogs[0].id
  );

  return (
    <>
      <select
        onChange={(e) => setSelectedDog(e.target.value)}
      >
        {data.dogs.map(({ id, name }) => (
          <option key={id} value={id}>
            {name}
          </option>
        ))}
      </select>
      <ErrorBoundary
        fallback={<div>Something went wrong</div>}
      >
        <Suspense fallback={<div>Loading...</div>}>
          <Dog id={selectedDog} />
        </Suspense>
      </ErrorBoundary>
    </>
  );
}
```

Here, we're using our `ErrorBoundary` component and placing it **outside** of our `Dog` component. Now, when the `useSuspenseQuery` hook inside the `Dog` component throws an error, the `ErrorBoundary` will catch it and display the `fallback` element we've provided.

> **Note:** when working with many React frameworks, you may see an error dialog overlay in development mode when errors are thrown, even **with** an error boundary. This is done to avoid the error being missed by developers.

#### Rendering partial data alongside errors

In some cases, you may want to ignore GraphQL errors and render partial data instead or alongside an error message. To do this, you can set the `errorPolicy` option to `ignore` (`graphQLErrors` are ignored and `error.graphQLErrors` is _not_ populated) or `all` (both `data` and `error.graphQLErrors` are populated, enabling you to render both partial results and error information).

Note that with both error policies of `ignore` and `all`, when encountering a **network error** Apollo Client's Suspense hooks will always throw an error wherever the data is being read (i.e. in the component calling `useSuspenseQuery` or `useReadQuery`).

### Distinguishing between queries with `queryKey`

By default, Apollo Client uses a query's `DocumentNode` and `Variables` to uniquely identify a query when using Apollo's `Suspense` data fetching hooks.

In practice, this means if you have two components both fetching data using the same `DocumentNode` and `variables`, they will both suspend when either component initiates or re-initiates a network request.

__In rare cases__, you may want to avoid suspending in one component when other components are fetching the same data with the same variables. To do this, you can use the `queryKey` option provided to either `useSuspenseQuery` or `useBackgroundQuery` to uniquely identify a query. When `queryKey` is provided, Apollo Client will use it to identify a query **in combination with its `DocumentNode` and `Variables`**. For more information, see [`useSuspenseQuery`](../api/react/hooks/#usesuspensequery) or [`useBackgroundQuery`](../api/react/hooks/#usebackgroundquery-and-usereadquery)'s API docs.

### Avoiding request waterfalls

Since `useSuspenseQuery` will usually cause a component to suspend on first render while data is being fetched, a tree of components that all use `useSuspenseQuery` to query different data can cause a "waterfall" of Suspense boundaries to display since each component will suspend before rendering its children (which will then suspend while fetching, and so on). In some cases, this can be avoided by using `useBackgroundQuery` and `useReadQuery` instead.

`useBackgroundQuery` initiates a request for data in a parent component and returns a `QueryReference` which is then passed to `useReadQuery` to read the data in a child component. If the child component attempts to render before data is loaded, the child component will suspend. On cache updates to watched data, the child component calling `useReadQuery` will re-render with new data **but the parent component will not re-render** (as it would, for example, if `useQuery` was making the request in the parent).

Let's look at an example:

```tsx {2,8,33,37}
import {
  useBackgroundQuery,
  useReadQuery,
  useSuspenseQuery,
} from '@apollo/client';

function App() {
  const [queryRef] = useBackgroundQuery(GET_BREEDS_QUERY);

  return (
    <Suspense fallback={<div>Loading...</div>}>
      <Dog id="3" queryRef={queryRef} />
    </Suspense>
  );
}

function Dog({ id, queryRef }: DogProps) {
  const { data } = useSuspenseQuery(GET_DOG_QUERY, {
    variables: { id },
  });

  return (
    <>
      Name: {data.dog.name}
      <Suspense fallback={<div>Loading breeds...</div>}>
        <Breeds queryRef={queryRef} />
      </Suspense>
    </>
  );
}

interface BreedsProps {
  queryRef: QueryReference<BreedData>;
}

function Breeds({ queryRef }: BreedsProps) {
  const { data } = useReadQuery(queryRef);

  return data.breeds.map(({ characteristics }) =>
    characteristics.map((characteristic) => (
      <div key={characteristic}>{characteristic}</div>
    ))
  );
}
```

Since we began fetching our `GET_BREEDS_QUERY` when the parent `App` component mounted, the network request is made in the background while React attempts to render the rest of our component tree. When React reaches the `Dog` component, it immediately suspends as it makes a network request to fetch our `GET_DOG_QUERY`.

When the network request for `GET_DOG_QUERY` completes, the `Dog` component unsuspends and continues rendering, reaching the `Breeds` component. Since our `GET_BREEDS_QUERY` request was initiated higher up in our component tree using `useBackgroundQuery`, the network request for `GET_BREEDS_QUERY` **has already completed**! For that reason, when the `Breeds` component attempts to read the data using the `queryRef` for the original query, it **doesn't suspend**. Instead, it can render immediately with the data from the cache.

### `refetch`, `fetchMore` and `subscribeToMore`

Apollo's Suspense data fetching hooks return functions for re-initiating the same query (with existing or new variables) or to fetch more paginated data. `useSuspenseQuery` also provides a `subscribeToMore` function to execute a subscription.

When using `useBackgroundQuery`, both `refetch` and `fetchMore` functions can be destructured from the second item in the tuple returned by the hook.

Let's take a look at an example:

```tsx {1,3-5,12-15,18-20,49,57,62}
import { Suspense, useTransition } from "react";
import {
  useSuspenseQuery,
  useBackgroundQuery,
  useReadQuery,
  gql,
  TypedDocumentNode,
  QueryReference,
} from "@apollo/client";

function App() {
  const [isPending, startTransition] = useTransition();
  const [queryRef, { refetch }] = useBackgroundQuery(
    GET_BREEDS_QUERY
  );

  const refetchHandler = () => {
    startTransition(() => {
      refetch();
    });
  };

  return (
    <Suspense fallback={<div>Loading...</div>}>
      <Dog
        id="3"
        queryRef={queryRef}
        isPending={isPending}
        refetchHandler={refetchHandler}
      />
    </Suspense>
  );
}

function Dog({
  id,
  queryRef,
  isPending,
  refetchHandler,
}: DogProps) {
  const { data } = useSuspenseQuery(GET_DOG_QUERY, {
    variables: { id },
  });

  return (
    <>
      Name: {data.dog.name}
      <Suspense fallback={<div>Loading breeds...</div>}>
        <Breeds isPending={isPending} queryRef={queryRef} />
      </Suspense>
      <button onClick={refetchHandler}>Refetch!</button>
    </>
  );
}

function Breeds({ queryRef, isPending }: BreedsProps) {
  const { data } = useReadQuery(queryRef);

  return data.breeds.map(({ characteristics }) =>
    characteristics.map((characteristic) => (
      <div
        style={{ opacity: `${isPending ? 0.5 : 1}` }}
        key={characteristic}
      >
        {characteristic}
      </div>
    ))
  );
}
```

In this example, every time the user clicks the "Refetch!" button rendered by the `Dog` component, our `refetchHandler` calls the `refetch` function returned by `useBackgroundQuery` which initiates a new network request for the `GET_BREEDS_QUERY` query.

While each `refetch` would normally cause the `Breeds` component to re-suspend and display its nearest Suspense boundary by default, by wrapping it in `startTransition` we can avoid suspending and instead continue displaying the previous render while we fetch new data! React's `useTransition` hook also provides an `isPending` boolean we can use to determine whether our transition is pending. In this example, we use `isPending` to render our list of breed characteristics with a lower opacity while refetching the data.

## React Server Components (RSC)

### Usage with Next.js 13 App Router

In Next.js v13, Next.js's new [App Router](https://nextjs.org/docs/app) brought the React community the first framework with full support for [React Server Components (RSC)](https://react.dev/blog/2023/03/22/react-labs-what-we-have-been-working-on-march-2023#react-server-components) and Streaming SSR, integrating Suspense as a first-class concept from your application's routing layer all the way down.

In order to integrate with these features, our Apollo Client team released an experimental package, [`@apollo/experimental-nextjs-app-support`](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-client-nextjs), which allows for seamless use of Apollo Client with both RSC and Streaming SSR, one of the first of its kind for data fetching libraries. See its [README](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-client-nextjs#readme) and our [introductory blog post](https://www.apollographql.com/blog/apollo-client/next-js/how-to-use-apollo-client-with-next-js-13/) for more details.

#### Streaming while fetching with `useBackgroundQuery` during streaming SSR

In a client-rendered application, `useBackgroundQuery` can be used to avoid request waterfalls, but its impact can be even more noticeable in an application using streaming SSR as the App Router does. This is because the server can begin streaming content to the client, bringing even greater performance benefits.

### Error handling

In a purely client-rendered app, errors thrown in components are always caught and displayed by the closest [error boundary](https://react.dev/reference/react/Component#static-getderivedstatefromerror).

Errors thrown on the server when using one of the [streaming server rendering APIs](https://react.dev/reference/react-dom/server) are treated differently. See the [React documentation](https://react.dev/reference/react/Suspense#providing-a-fallback-for-server-errors-and-client-only-content) for more information.

title: Recompose patterns
---

[Recompose](https://github.com/acdlite/recompose) is a toolbelt for working with React components in a reusable, functional way. The workflow is similar to libraries like Underscore or Lodash, which can help you avoid re-implementing common patterns and keep your code [DRY](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don%27t_repeat_yourself). Check out the [Recompose API](https://github.com/acdlite/recompose/blob/master/docs/API.md) for all the details.

<h2 id="loading-status">Loading status</h2>

A common use-case when using the `graphql` HOC is to display a "loading" screen while your data is being fetched. We often end up with something like this:

```js
const Component = props => {
  if (props.data.loading) {
    return <LoadingPlaceholder>
  }

  return (
    <div>Our component</div>
  )
}
```

Recompose has a utility function `branch()` which lets us compose different HOCs based on the results of a test function. We can combine it with another Recompose method, `renderComponent()`. So we can say "If we are loading, render `LoadingPlaceholder` instead of our default component", like so:

```js
import { propType } from 'graphql-anywhere'

const renderWhileLoading = (component, propName = 'data') =>
  branch(
    props => props[propName] && props[propName].loading,
    renderComponent(component),
  );

const Component = props => (<div>Our component for {props.user.name}</div>)
Component.propTypes = {
  // autogenerated proptypes should be in place (if no error)
  user: propType(getUser).isRequired,
}

const enhancedComponent = compose(
  graphql(getUser, { name: "user" }),
  renderWhileLoading(LoadingPlaceholder, "user")
)(Component);

export default enhancedComponent;
```

This way, our wrapped component is only rendered outside of the loading state. That means we only need to take care of 2 states: error or successful load.

> Note: `loading` is only `true` during the first fetch for a particular query. But if you enable [options.notifyOnNetworkStatusChange](../basics/queries.html#graphql-config-options-notifyOnNetworkStatusChange) you can keep track of other loading status using the [data.networkStatus](../basics/queries.html#graphql-query-data-networkStatus) field. You can use a similar pattern to the above.

<h2 id="error-handling">Error handling</h2>

Similar to the loading state above, we might want to display a different component in the case of an error, or let the user `refetch()`. We will use `withProps()` to include the refetch method directly in the props. This way our universal error handler can always expect it to be there and is more decoupled.

```js
const renderForError = (component, propName = "data") =>
  branch(
    props => props[propName] && props[propName].error,
    renderComponent(component),
  );

const ErrorComponent = props =>(
  <span>
    Something went wrong, you can try to
    <button onClick={props.refetch}>refetch</button>
  </span>
)

const setRefetchProp = (propName = "data") =>
  withProps(props => ({refetch: props[propName] && props[propName].refetch}))

const enhancedComponent = compose(
  graphql(getUser, { name: "user" }),
  renderWhileLoading(LoadingPlaceholder, "user"),
  setRefetchProp("user"),
  renderForError(ErrorComponent, "user"),
)(Component);

export default enhancedComponent;
```

Now we can count on results being available for our default component and don't have to manually check for loading state or errors inside the `render` function.

<h2 id="query-lifecycle">Query lifecycle</h2>

There are some use-cases when we need to execute code after a query finishes fetching. From the example above, we would render our default component only when there is no error and loading is finished.

But it is just a stateless component; it has no lifecycle hooks. If we need extra lifecycle functionality, Recompose's `lifecycle()` comes to the rescue:

```js
const execAtMount = lifecycle({
  componentWillMount() {
    executeSomething();
  },
})

const enhancedComponent = compose(
  graphql(getUser, { name: "user" }),
  renderWhileLoading(LoadingPlaceholder, "user"),
  setRefetchProp("user"),
  renderForError(ErrorComponent, "user"),
  execAtMount,
)(Component);
```

The above works well if we just want something to happen at component mount time.

Let's define another more advanced use-case, for example, using `react-select` to let a user pick an option from the results of a query. I want to always display the react-select, which has its own loading state indicator. Then, I want to automatically select the predefined option after the query finishes fetching.

There is one caveat: we need to be aware that the query can skip the loading state when data is already in the cache. That would mean we need to handle `networkStatus === 7` on mount.

We will also use recompose's `withState()` to keep value for our option picker. For this example we will assume the default `data` prop name is unchanged.

```js
const DEFAULT_PICK = "orange";
const withPickerValue = withState("pickerValue", "setPickerValue", null);

// find matching option
const findOption = (options, ourLabel) =>
  lodashFind(options, option => option.label.toLowerCase() === ourLabel.toLowerCase());

const withAutoPicking = lifecycle({
  componentWillReceiveProps(nextProps) {
    // when value was already picked
    if (nextProps.pickerValue) {
      return;
    }
    // networkStatus changed from 1 to 7, meaning initial load finished successfully
    if (this.props.data.networkStatus === 1 && nextProps.data.networkStatus === 7) {
      const match = findOption(nextProps.data.options)
      if (match) {
        nextProps.setPickerValue(match);
      }
    }
  },
  componentWillMount() {
    const { pickerValue, setPickerValue, data } = this.props;
    if (pickerValue) {
      return;
    }
    // when Apollo query is resolved from cache,
    // it already has networkStatus 7 at mount time
    if (data.networkStatus === 7 && !data.error) {
      const match = findOption(data.options);
      if (match) {
        setPickerValue(match);
      }
    }
  },
});

const Component = props => (
  <Select
    loading={props.data.loading}
    value={props.pickerValue && props.pickerValue.value || null}
    onChange={props.setPickerValue}
    options={props.data.options || undefined}
  />
);

const enhancedComponent = compose(
  graphql(getOptions),
  withPickerValue,
  withAutoPicking,
)(Component);
```

<h2 id="controlling-poll-interval">Controlling pollInterval</h2>

This case is borrowed from [David Glasser's post on the Apollo blog](https://blog.apollographql.com/dynamic-graphql-polling-with-react-and-apollo-client-fb36e390d250) about the Meteor's Galaxy UI migrations panel implementation. In the post, he says:

> We’re not usually running any migrations, so a nice, slow polling interval like 30 seconds seemed reasonable. But in the rare case where a migration is running, I wanted to be able to see much faster updates on its progress.

> The key to this is knowing that the `options` parameter to react-apollo’s main graphql function can itself be a function that depends on its incoming React props. (The `options` parameter describes the options for the query itself, as opposed to React-specific details like what property name to use for data.) We can then use recompose's `withState()` to set the poll interval from a prop passed in to the graphql component, and use the `componentWillReceiveProps` React lifecycle event (added via the recompose lifecycle helper) to look at the fetched GraphQL data and adjust if necessary.

Let's look at the code:

```js
import { graphql } from "react-apollo";
import gql from "graphql-tag";
import { compose, withState, lifecycle } from "recompose";

const DEFAULT_INTERVAL = 30 * 1000;
const ACTIVE_INTERVAL = 500;

const withData = compose(
  // Pass down two props to the nested component: `pollInterval`,
  // which defaults to our normal slow poll, and `setPollInterval`,
  // which lets the nested components modify `pollInterval`.
  withState("pollInterval", "setPollInterval", DEFAULT_INTERVAL),
  graphql(
    gql`
      query GetMigrationStatus {
        activeMigration {
          name
          version
          progress
        }
      }
    `,
    {
      // If you think it's clear enough, you can abbreviate this as:
      //   options: ({pollInterval}) => ({pollInterval}),
      options: props => {
        return {
          pollInterval: props.pollInterval
        };
      }
    }
  ),
  lifecycle({
    componentWillReceiveProps({
      data: { loading, activeMigration },
      pollInterval,
      setPollInterval
    }) {
      if (loading) {
        return;
      }
      if (activeMigration && pollInterval !== ACTIVE_INTERVAL) {
        setPollInterval(ACTIVE_INTERVAL);
      } else if (
        !activeMigration &&
        pollInterval !== DEFAULT_INTERVAL
      ) {
        setPollInterval(DEFAULT_INTERVAL);
      }
    }
  })
);
const MigrationPanelWithData = withData(MigrationPanel);
```

Note that we check the current value of `pollInterval` before changing it because, by default in React, nested components will get re-rendered any time we change state, even if you change it to the same value. You can deal with this using `shouldComponentUpdate` or `React.PureComponent`, but in this case it’s straightforward just to only set the state when it’s actually changing.

<h2 id="other">Other use-cases</h2>

Recompose is a powerful tool and can be applied to all sorts of other cases. Here are a few final examples.

Normally, if you wanted to add side effects to the `mutate` function, you would manage them in the `graphql` HOC's [`props` option](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/react/api/react-apollo.html#graphql-config-props) by doing something like `{ mutate: () => mutate().then(sideEffectHandler) }`. But that's not very reusable. Using recompose's `withHandlers()` you can compose the same prop manipulation in any number of components. You can see a more detailed example [here](https://medium.com/front-end-developers/how-i-write-mutations-in-apollo-w-recompose-1c0ab06ef4ea).

Mutations can also be tracked using recompose's `withState`, since it has no effect on your query's `loading` state. For example, you could use it to disable buttons while submitting form data.

title: REST Link
description: Call REST APIs inside your GraphQL queries.
---

## Overview

Calling REST APIs from a GraphQL client opens the benefits of GraphQL for more people, whether:

* You are in a front-end developer team that wants to try GraphQL without asking for the backend team to implement a GraphQL server.
* You have no access to change the backend because it's an existing set of APIs, potentially managed by a 3rd party.
* You have an existing codebase, but you're looking to evaluate whether GraphQL can work for your needs.
* You have a large codebase, and the GraphQL migration is happening on the backend, but you want to use GraphQL *now* without waiting!

With `apollo-link-rest`, you can call your endpoints inside your GraphQL queries and have all your data managed by Apollo Client. `apollo-link-rest` is suitable for just dipping your toes in the water, or doing a full-steam ahead integration, and then later on migrating to a backend-driven GraphQL experience.

> For more advanced or complex back-ends, you may want to consider using [`apollo-server`](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/apollo-server/).

## Quick start

To get started, first install Apollo Client and any `peerDependencies` we need:

```bash
npm install --save @apollo/client apollo-link-rest graphql qs
```

After this, you're ready to setup the Apollo Client instance:

```js
import { ApolloClient, InMemoryCache } from '@apollo/client';
import { RestLink } from 'apollo-link-rest';

// Set `RestLink` with your endpoint
const restLink = new RestLink({ uri: "https://swapi.dev/api/" });

// Setup your client
const client = new ApolloClient({
  cache: new InMemoryCache(),
  link: restLink
});
```

Now it's time to write our first query. Defining a query is straightforward:

```js
import { gql } from '@apollo/client';

const query = gql`
  query Luke {
    person @rest(type: "Person", path: "people/1/") {
      name
    }
  }
`;
```

You can then fetch your data using Apollo Client:

```js
// Invoke the query and log the person's name
client.query({ query }).then(response => {
  console.log(response.data.name);
});
```

## Options

The `RestLink` constructor accepts an options object that can be used to customize the behavior of the link. Supported options are outlined below:

| Option | Type | Description |
| - | - | - |
| `uri` | `string` | The URI key is a string endpoint/domain for your requests to hit (_optional_ when `endpoints` provides a default) |
| `endpoints: /map-of-endpoints/` | `any` | _optional_ A map of endpoints. If you use this, you need to provide `endpoint` to the `@rest(...)` directives. |
| `customFetch?` | `any` | _optional_ A custom `fetch` to handle `REST` calls |
| `headers?` | `Headers` | _optional_ An object representing values to be sent as headers with all requests. [Documented here](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Request/headers) |
| `credentials?` | `string` | _optional_ A string representing the credentials policy the fetch call should operate with. [Document here](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Request/credentials) |
| `fieldNameNormalizer?: /function/` | `any` | _optional_ A function that takes the response field name and converts it into a GraphQL compliant name. This is useful if your `REST` API returns fields that aren't representable as GraphQL, or if you want to convert between `snake_case` field names in JSON to `camelCase` keyed fields. |
| `fieldNameDenormalizer?: /function/` | `any` | _optional_ A function that takes a GraphQL-compliant field name and converts it back into an endpoint-specific name. |
| `typePatcher: /map-of-functions/` | `any` | _optional_ A structure to allow you to specify the `__typename` when you have nested objects in your REST response. |
| `defaultSerializer /function/` | `any` | _optional_ A function that will be used by the `RestLink` as the default serializer when no `bodySerializer` is defined for a `@rest` call. The function will also be passed the current `Header` set, which can be updated before the request is sent to `fetch`. Default method uses `JSON.stringify` and sets the `Content-Type` to `application/json`. |
| `bodySerializers: /map-of-functions/` | `any` | _optional_ Structure to allow the definition of alternative serializers, which can then be specified by their key. |
| `responseTransformer?: /function/` | `any` | _optional_ Apollo expects a record response to return a root object, and a collection of records response to return an array of objects. Use this function to structure the response into the format Apollo expects if your response data is structured differently. |

### Multiple endpoints

If you want to be able to use multiple endpoints, you can create your link like:

```js
const link = new RestLink({ endpoints: { v1: 'api.com/v1', v2: 'api.com/v2' } });
```

You then need to specify the endpoint you want to use, in the rest directive:

```js
const postTitleQuery1 = gql`
  query PostTitle {
    post @rest(type: "Post", path: "/post", endpoint: "v1") {
      id
      title
    }
  }
`;
const postTitleQuery2 = gql`
  query PostTitle {
    post @rest(type: "[Tag]", path: "/tags", endpoint: "v2") {
      id
      tags
    }
  }
`;
```

If you have a default endpoint, you can create your link like:

```js
const link = new RestLink({
  endpoints: { github: 'github.com' },
  uri: 'api.com',
});
```

If you don't specify an endpoint in your query, the default endpoint (the one you specify in the `uri` option) will be used.

### Typename patching

When sending a query like:

```graphql
query MyQuery {
  planets @rest(type: "PlanetPayload", path: "planets/") {
    count
    next
    results {
      name
    }
  }
}
```

the outer response object (`data.planets`) gets its `__typename: "PlanetPayload"` from the [`@rest(...)` directive's `type` parameter](#rest-directive). You, however, need to have a way to set the typename of `PlanetPayload.results`.

One way you can do this is by providing a `typePatcher`:

```typescript
const restLink = new RestLink({
  uri: '/api',
  typePatcher: {
    PlanetPayload: (
      data: any,
      outerType: string,
      patchDeeper: RestLink.FunctionalTypePatcher,
    ): any => {
      if (data.results != null) {
        data.results =
          data.results.map(planet => ({ __typename: "Planet", ...planet }));
      }
      return data;
    },
    // ... other nested type patchers
  },
})
```

If you have a very lightweight REST integration, you can use the `@type(name: ...)` directive.

```graphql
query MyQuery {
  planets @rest(type: "PlanetPayload", path: "planets/") {
    count
    next
    results @type(name: "Planet") {
      name
    }
  }
}
```

This is appropriate if you have a small list of nested objects. The cost of this strategy is that every query that deals with these objects needs to also include `@type(name: ...)`, which means this approach can be quite verbose and error prone.

You can also use both of these approaches in tandem:

```graphql
query MyQuery {
  planets @rest(type: "PlanetPayload", path: "planets/") {
    count
    next
    results @type(name: "Results") {
      name
    }
    typePatchedResults {
      name
    }
  }
}
```

```typescript
const restLink = new RestLink({
  uri: '/api',
  typePatcher: {
    PlanetPayload: (
      data: any,
      outerType: string,
      patchDeeper: RestLink.FunctionalTypePatcher,
    ): any => {
      if (data.typePatchedResults != null) {
        data.typePatchedResults =
          data.typePatchedResults.map(planet => { __typename: "Planet", ...planet });
      }
      return data;
    },
    // ... other nested type patchers
  },
})
```

#### Warning

It's important to note that at the moment the `typePatcher` is not able to act on nested objects within annotated `@type` objects. For instance, `failingResults` will not be patched if you define it on the `typePatcher`:

```graphql
query MyQuery {
  planets @rest(type: "PlanetPayload", path: "planets/") {
    count
    next
    results @type(name: "Planet") {
      name
      failingResults {
        name
      }
    }
    typePatchedResults {
      name
    }
  }
}
```

To make this work you should try to pick one strategy, and stick with it -- either all `typePatcher` or all `@type` directives.

### Response transforming

By default, Apollo expects an object at the root for record requests, and an array of objects at the root for collection requests. For example, if fetching a user by ID (`/users/1`), the following response is expected.

```json
{
  "id": 1,
  "name": "Apollo"
}
```

And when fetching for a list of users (`/users`), the following response is expected.

```json
[
  {
    "id": 1,
    "name": "Apollo"
  },
  {
    "id": 2,
    "name": "Starman"
  }
]
```

If the structure of your API responses differs than what Apollo expects, you can define a `responseTransformer` in the client. This function receives the response object as the 1st argument, and the current `typeName` as the 2nd argument. It should return a `Promise` as it will be responsible for reading the response stream by calling one of `json()`, `text()` etc.

For example, if the record is not at the root level:

```json
{
  "meta": {},
  "data": [
    {
      "id": 1,
      "name": "Apollo"
    },
    {
      "id": 2,
      "name": "Starman"
    }
  ]
}
```

The following transformer could be used to support it:

```js
const link = new RestLink({
  uri: '/api',
  responseTransformer: async response => response.json().then(({data}) => data),
});
```

Plaintext, XML, or otherwise-encoded responses can be handled by manually parsing and converting them to JSON (using the previously described format that Apollo expects):

```js
const link = new RestLink({
  uri: '/xmlApi',
  responseTransformer: async response => response.text().then(text => parseXmlResponseToJson(text)),
});
```

### Custom endpoint responses

The client level `responseTransformer` applies for all responses, across all URIs and endpoints. If you need a custom `responseTransformer` per endpoint, you can define an object of options for that specific endpoint.

```js
const link = new RestLink({
  endpoints: {
    v1: {
      uri: '/v1',
      responseTransformer: async response => response.data,
    },
    v2: {
      uri: '/v2',
      responseTransformer: async (response, typeName) => response[typeName],
    },
  },
});
```

> When using the object form, the `uri` field is required.

### Custom Fetch

By default, Apollo uses the browsers `fetch` method to handle `REST` requests to your domain/endpoint. The `customFetch` option allows you to specify _your own_ request handler by defining a function that returns a `Promise` with a fetch-response-like object:

```js
const link = new RestLink({
  endpoints: "/api",
  customFetch: (uri, options) => new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
    // Your own (asynchronous) request handler
    resolve(responseObject)
  }),
});
```

To resolve your GraphQL queries quickly, Apollo will issue requests to relevant endpoints as soon as possible. This is generally ok, but can lead to large numbers of `REST` requests to be fired at once; especially for deeply nested queries [(see `@export` directive)](#export-directive).

> Some endpoints (like public APIs) might enforce _rate limits_, leading to failed responses and unresolved queries in such cases.

By example, `customFetch` is a good place to manage your apps fetch operations. The following implementation makes sure to only issue 2 requests at a time (concurrency) while waiting at least 500ms until the next batch of requests is fired.

```js
import pThrottle from "p-throttle";

const link = new RestLink({
  endpoints: "/api",
  customFetch: pThrottle((uri, config) => {
      return fetch(uri, config);
    },
    2, // Max. concurrent Requests
    500 // Min. delay between calls
  ),
});
```
> Since Apollo issues `Promise` based requests, we can resolve them as we see fit. This example uses [`pThrottle`](https://github.com/sindresorhus/p-throttle); part of the popular [promise-fun](https://github.com/sindresorhus/promise-fun) collection.

### Complete options

Here is one way you might customize `RestLink`:

```js
import fetch from 'cross-fetch';
import * as camelCase from 'camelcase';
import * as snake_case from 'snake-case';

const link = new RestLink({
  endpoints: { github: 'github.com' },
  uri: 'api.com',
  customFetch: fetch,
  headers: {
    "Content-Type": "application/json"
  },
  credentials: "same-origin",
  fieldNameNormalizer: (key: string) => camelCase(key),
  fieldNameDenormalizer: (key: string) => snake_case(key),
  typePatcher: {
    Post: ()=> {
      bodySnippet...
    }
  },
  defaultSerializer: (data: any, headers: Headers) => {
    const formData = new FormData();
    for (let key in body) {
      formData.append(key, body[key]);
    }
    headers.set("Content-Type", "x-www-form-encoded")
    return {body: formData, headers};
  }
});
```

## Link Context

`RestLink` has an [interface `LinkChainContext`](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-link-rest/blob/1824da47d5db77a2259f770d9c9dd60054c4bb1c/src/restLink.ts#L557-L570) which it uses as the structure of things that it will look for in the `context`, as it decides how to fulfill a specific `RestLink` request. (Please see the [`@apollo/client/link/context`](./apollo-link-context) page for a discussion of why you might want this).

| Option | Type | Description |
| - | - | - |
| `credentials?` | `RequestCredentials` | Overrides the `RestLink`-level setting for `credentials`. [Values documented here](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Request/headers) |
| `headers?` | `Headers` | Additional headers provided in this `context-link` [Values documented here](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Request/headers) |
| `headersToOverride?` | `string[]` | If you provide this array, we will merge the headers you provide in this link, by replacing any matching headers that exist in the root `RestLink` configuration. Alternatively you can use `headersMergePolicy` for more fine-grained customization of the merging behavior. |
| `headersMergePolicy?` | `RestLink.HeadersMergePolicy` | This is a function that decide how the headers returned in this `contextLink` are merged with headers defined at the `RestLink`-level. If you don't provide this, the headers will be simply appended. To use this option, you can provide your own function that decides how to process the headers. [Code references](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-link-rest/blob/8e57cabb5344209d9cfa391c1614fe8880efa5d9/src/restLink.ts#L462-L510) |
| `restResponses?` | `Response[]` | This will be populated after the operation has completed with the [Responses](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Response) of every REST url fetched during the operation. This can be useful if you need to access the response headers to grab an authorization token for example. |

### Example

`RestLink` uses the `headers` field on the [`@apollo/client/link/context`](./apollo-link-context) so you can compose other links that provide additional & dynamic headers to a given query.

Here is one way to add request `headers` to the context and retrieve the response headers of the operation:

```js
const authRestLink = new ApolloLink((operation, forward) => {
  operation.setContext(({headers}) => {
    const token = localStorage.getItem("token");
    return {
      headers: {
        ...headers,
        Accept: "application/json",
        Authorization: token
      }
    };
  });
  return forward(operation).map(result => {
    const { restResponses } = operation.getContext();
    const authTokenResponse = restResponses.find(res => res.headers.has("Authorization"));
    // You might also filter on res.url to find the response of a specific API call
    if (authTokenResponse) {
      localStorage.setItem("token", authTokenResponse.headers.get("Authorization"));
    }
    return result;
  });
});

const restLink = new RestLink({ uri: "uri" });

const client = new ApolloClient({
  cache: new InMemoryCache(),
  link: ApolloLink.from([authRestLink, restLink])
});
```

## Link order

If you are using multiple link types, `restLink` should go before `httpLink`, as `httpLink` will swallow any calls that should be routed through `apollo-link-rest`.

For example:

```js
const httpLink = createHttpLink({ uri: "server.com/graphql" });
const restLink = new RestLink({ uri: "api.server.com" });

const client = new ApolloClient({
  cache: new InMemoryCache(),
  link: ApolloLink.from([authLink, restLink, errorLink, retryLink, httpLink])
  // Note: httpLink is terminating so must be last, while retry & error wrap
  // the links to their right. State & context links should happen before (to
  // the left of) restLink.
});
```

_Note: you should also consider this if you're using [`@apollo/client/link/context`](./apollo-link-context) to set `Headers`, you need that link to be before `restLink` as well._

## @rest directive

This is where you setup the endpoint you want to fetch. The rest directive can be used at any depth in a query.

### Arguments

An `@rest(…)` directive takes two required and several optional arguments:

| Option | Type | Description |
| - | - | - |
| `type` | `string` | The GraphQL type this will return |
| `path` | `string` | uri-path to the REST API. This could be a path or a full url. If a path, the endpoint given on link creation or from the context is concatenated with it to produce a full `URI`. See also: `pathBuilder` |
| `method?` | `GET`  `PUT` `POST` `DELETE` | The HTTP method to send the request via (i.e GET, PUT, POST) |
| `endpoint?` | `string` | Key to use when looking up the endpoint in the (optional) `endpoints` table if provided to RestLink at creation time. |
| `pathBuilder?: /function/` | `string` | If provided, this function gets to control what path is produced for this request. |
| `bodyKey?: "input"` | `string` | This is the name of the `variable` to use when looking to build a REST request-body for a `PUT` or `POST` request. It defaults to `input` if not supplied. |
| `bodyBuilder?: /function/` | `string` | If provided, this is the name a `function` that you provided to `variables`, that is called when a request-body needs to be built. This lets you combine arguments or encode the body in some format other than JSON. |
| `bodySerializer?: /string | function/` | `string` | String key to look up a function in `bodySerializers` or a custom serialization function for the body/headers of this request before it is passed to the fetch call. Defaults to `JSON.stringify` and setting `Content-Type: application-json`. |

### Variables

You can use query `variables` inside nested queries, or in the the path argument of your directive:

```graphql
query PostTitle {
  post(id: "1") @rest(type: "Post", path: "/post/{args.id}") {
    id
    title
  }
}
```

> **Warning**: Variables in the main path will not automatically have `encodeURIComponent` called on them.

Additionally, you can also control the query-string:

```graphql
query PostTitle {
  postSearch(query: "some key words", page_size: 5)
    @rest(type: "Post", path: "/search?{args}&{context.language}") {
    id
    title
  }
}
```

Things to note:

1. This will be converted into `/search?query=some%20key%20words&page_size=5&lang=en`
2. The `context.language / lang=en` is extracting an object from the Apollo Context, that was added via an `@apollo/client/link/context` Link.
3. The query string arguments are assembled by npm:qs and have `encodeURIComponent` called on them.

The available variable sources are:

| Option | Description |
| - | - |
| `args` | These are the things passed directly to this field parameters. In the above example `postSearch` had `query` and `page_size` in args. |
| `exportVariables` | These are the things in the parent context that were tagged as `@export(as: ...)` |
| `context` | These are the apollo-context, so you can have globals set up via `@apollo/client/link/context` |
| `@rest` | These include any other parameters you pass to the `@rest()` directive. This is probably more useful when working with `pathBuilder`, documented below. |

#### `pathBuilder`

If the variable-replacement options described above aren't enough, you can provide a `pathBuilder` to your query. This will be called to dynamically construct the path. This is considered an advanced feature, and is documented in the source -- it also should be considered syntactically unstable, and we're looking for feedback!

#### `bodyKey` / `bodyBuilder`

When making a `POST` or `PUT` HTTP request, you often need to provide a request body. By [convention](https://graphql.org/graphql-js/mutations-and-input-types/), GraphQL recommends you name your input-types as `input`, so by default that's where we'll look to find a JSON object for your body.

##### `bodyKey`

If you need/want to name it something different, you can pass `bodyKey`, and we'll look at that variable instead.

In this example the publish API accepts a body in the variable `body` instead of input:

```graphql
mutation PublishPost(
  $someApiWithACustomBodyKey: PublishablePostInput!
) {
  publishedPost: publish(input: "Foo", body: $someApiWithACustomBodyKey)
    @rest(
      type: "Post"
      path: "/posts/{args.input}/new"
      method: "POST"
      bodyKey: "body"
    ) {
    id
    title
  }
}
```

[Unit Test](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-link-rest/blob/c9d81ae308e5f61b5ae992061de7abc6cb2f78e0/src/__tests__/restLink.ts#L1803-L1846)

##### `bodyBuilder`

If you need to structure your data differently, or you need to custom encode your body (say as form-encoded), you can provide `bodyBuilder` instead:

```graphql
mutation EncryptedPost(
  $input: PublishablePostInput!
  $encryptor: any
) {
  publishedPost: publish(input: $input)
    @rest(
      type: "Post"
      path: "/posts/new"
      method: "POST"
      bodyBuilder: $encryptor
    ) {
    id
    title
  }
}
```

[Unit Test](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-link-rest/blob/c9d81ae308e5f61b5ae992061de7abc6cb2f78e0/src/__tests__/restLink.ts#L1847-L1904)

##### `bodySerializer`

If you need to serialize your data differently (say as form-encoded), you can provide a `bodySerializer` instead of relying on the default JSON serialization.
`bodySerializer` can be either a function of the form `(data: any, headers: Headers) => {body: any, header: Headers}` or a string key. When using the string key
`RestLink` will instead use the corresponding serializer from the `bodySerializers` object, that can optionally be passed in during initialization.

```graphql
mutation EncryptedForm(
  $input: PublishablePostInput!,
  $formSerializer: any
) {
  publishedPost: publish(input: $input)
    @rest(
      type: "Post",
      path: "/posts/new",
      method: "POST",
      bodySerializer: $formSerializer
    ) {
      id
      title
    }

  publishRSS(input: $input)
    @rest(
      type: "Post",
      path: "/feed",
      method: "POST",
      bodySerializer: "xml"
    )
}
```

Where `formSerializer` could be defined as

```typescript
const formSerializer = (data: any, headers: Headers) => {
  const formData = new FormData();
  for (let key in data) {
    if (data.hasOwnProperty(key)) {
      formData.append(key, data[key]);
    }
  }

  headers.set('Content-Type', 'application/x-www-form-urlencoded');

  return {body: formData, headers};
}

```

And `"xml"` would have been defined on the `RestLink` directly

```typescript
const restLink = new RestLink({
  ...otherOptions,
  bodySerializers: {
    xml: xmlSerializer
  }
})
```

## @export directive

The export directive re-exposes a field for use in a later (nested) query. These are the same semantics that will be supported on the server, but when used in a `RestLink` you can use the exported variables for further calls (i.e. waterfall requests from nested fields).

_Note: If you're constantly using @export you may prefer to take a look at [`apollo-server`](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/apollo-server/)._

### Arguments

* `as: string`: name to create this as a variable to be used down the selection set

### Example

An example use-case would be getting a list of users, and hitting a different endpoint to fetch more data using the exported field in the REST query args.

```graphql
const QUERY = gql`
  query RestData($email: String!) {
    users @rest(path: '/users/email?{args.email}', method: 'GET', type: 'User') {
      id @export(as: "id")
      firstName
      lastName
      friends @rest(path: '/friends/{exportVariables.id}', type: '[User]') {
        firstName
        lastName
      }
    }
  }
`;
```

## Mutations

You can write also mutations with the apollo-link-rest, for example:

```graphql
mutation DeletePost($id: ID!) {
  deletePostResponse(id: $id)
    @rest(type: "Post", path: "/posts/{args.id}", method: "DELETE") {
    NoResponse
  }
}
```

## Troubleshooting

Here are a few common `apollo-link-rest` problems and solutions.

* `Missing field __typename in ...` -- If you see this, it's possible you haven't provided `type:` to the [`@rest(...)`](#rest-directive)-directive. Alternately you need to set up a [`typePatcher`](#typename-patching).
* `Headers is undefined` -- If you see something like this, you're running in a browser or other Javascript environment that does not yet support the full specification for the `Headers` API.

## Example apps

To get you started, here are some example apps:

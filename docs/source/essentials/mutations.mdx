Now that we've learned how to fetch data with Apollo Client, what happens when we need to update that data? In this guide, you'll discover how to leverage the `useMutation` hook in your components to send updates to your GraphQL server. You'll also learn how to update the Apollo cache after a mutation occurs and how to handle errors when things go wrong.

This page assumes some familiarity with building GraphQL mutations. If you'd like a refresher, we recommend [reading this guide](http://graphql.org/learn/queries/#mutations).

The following examples assume that you've already set up Apollo Client and have wrapped your React app in an `ApolloProvider` component. Read our [getting started](/essentials/get-started/) guide if you need help with either of those steps. Let's dive in!

> If you'd like to follow along with the examples, open up our [starter project](https://codesandbox.io/s/znl94y0vp) on CodeSandbox, and our sample GraphQL server on [this CodeSandBox](https://codesandbox.io/s/plp0mopxq). You can view the completed version of the app [here](https://codesandbox.io/s/v3mn68xxvy).

## The `useMutation` hook

The `useMutation` hook, which is based on React's [Hooks API](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-intro.html), is what you'll use to trigger mutations from your UI. To run a mutation, just pass a GraphQL query string wrapped with the `gql` function into `useMutation` as the first parameter, when you call `useMutation` within a React component. When your component renders, `useMutation` will return a result tuple with a mutate function in the fist position, and an object with your mutation result (containing `loading`, `error`, `called` and `data` properties) in the second position. Let's look at an example:

<MultiCodeBlock>
<div data-language="Hooks (JavaScript)">

```jsx
import gql from 'graphql-tag';
import { useMutation } from '@apollo/react-hooks';

const ADD_TODO = gql`
  mutation AddTodo($type: String!) {
    addTodo(type: $type) {
      id
      type
    }
  }
`;

function AddTodo() {
  let input;
  const [addTodo, { data }] = useMutation(ADD_TODO);

  return (
    <div>
      <form
        onSubmit={e => {
          e.preventDefault();
          addTodo({ variables: { type: input.value } });
          input.value = '';
        }}
      >
        <input
          ref={node => {
            input = node;
          }}
        />
        <button type="submit">Add Todo</button>
      </form>
    </div>
  );
}
```

</div>
<div data-language="Render Props (JavaScript)">

```jsx
import gql from 'graphql-tag';
import { Mutation } from '@apollo/react-components';

const ADD_TODO = gql`
  mutation AddTodo($type: String!) {
    addTodo(type: $type) {
      id
      type
    }
  }
`;

const AddTodo = () => {
  let input;

  return (
    <Mutation mutation={ADD_TODO}>
      {(addTodo, { data }) => (
        <div>
          <form
            onSubmit={e => {
              e.preventDefault();
              addTodo({ variables: { type: input.value } });
              input.value = '';
            }}
          >
            <input
              ref={node => {
                input = node;
              }}
            />
            <button type="submit">Add Todo</button>
          </form>
        </div>
      )}
    </Mutation>
  );
};
```

</div>
</MultiCodeBlock>

First, create your GraphQL mutation, wrap it in `gql`, and pass it in as the first parameter to the `useMutation` hook. When called, the `useMutation` hook will return a tuple with a mutate function in the first position. This mutate function can be called to tell Apollo Client that you'd like to trigger a mutation. The mutate function optionally takes `variables`, `optimisticResponse`, `refetchQueries`, and `update`; however, you can also pass in those values as options to the `useMutation` hook. In the example, notice how we use the mutate function (called `addTodo`) to submit the form with our variables.

The value in the second position of the returned tuple is an object with your mutation result on the `data` property, as well as booleans for `loading` and if the mutate function was `called`, in addition to `error`. If you'd like to ignore the result of the mutation, pass `ignoreResults` as an option to `useMutation`.

If you're following along with the example on CodeSandbox, you probably noticed that the UI reflecting the list of todos did not update with our newly created todo when you submitted the form. This is because the todos query in the Apollo cache does not know about our newly created todo. In the next section, we'll learn when and how to update the Apollo cache after a mutation.

## Updating the cache

Sometimes when you perform a mutation, your GraphQL server and your Apollo cache become out of sync. This happens when the update you're performing depends on data that is already in the cache; for example, deleting and adding items to a list. We need a way to tell Apollo Client to update the query for the list of items. This is where the `update` function comes in! `update` functions aren't required to update the cache for all mutations, but our `addTodo` mutation is an example of where it comes in handy.

The update function is called with the Apollo cache as the first argument. The cache has several utility functions such as `cache.readQuery` and `cache.writeQuery` that allow you to read and write queries to the cache with GraphQL as if it were a server. There are other cache methods, such as `cache.readFragment`, `cache.writeFragment`, and `cache.writeData`, which you can learn about in our detailed [caching guide](/advanced/caching/) if you're curious.

**Note**: The `update` function receives `cache` rather than `client` as its first parameter. This `cache` is typically an instance of `InMemoryCache`, as supplied to the `ApolloClient` constructor when the client was created. In case of the `update` function, when you call `cache.writeQuery`, the update internally calls `broadcastQueries`, so queries listening to the changes will update. However, this behavior of broadcasting changes after `cache.writeQuery` happens only with the `update` function. Anywhere else, `cache.writeQuery` would just write to the cache, and the changes would not be immediately broadcast to the view layer. To avoid this confusion, prefer `client.writeQuery` when writing to cache.

The second argument to the update function is an object with a data property containing your mutation result. If you specify an [optimistic response](/features/optimistic-ui/), your update function will be called twice: once with your optimistic result, and another time with your actual result. You can use your mutation result to update the cache with `cache.writeQuery`.

Now that we've learned about the update function, let's implement one using the `useMutation` hook.

<MultiCodeBlock>
<div data-language="Hooks (JavaScript)">

```jsx
const GET_TODOS = gql`
  query GetTodos {
    todos
  }
`;

function AddTodo() {
  let input;
  const [addTodo] = useMutation(
    ADD_TODO,
    {
      update(cache, { data: { addTodo } }) {
        const { todos } = cache.readQuery({ query: GET_TODOS });
        cache.writeQuery({
          query: GET_TODOS,
          data: { todos: todos.concat([addTodo]) },
        });
      }
    }
  );

  return (
    <div>
      <form
        onSubmit={e => {
          e.preventDefault();
          addTodo({ variables: { type: input.value } });
          input.value = "";
        }}
      >
        <input
          ref={node => {
            input = node;
          }}
        />
        <button type="submit">Add Todo</button>
      </form>
    </div>
  );
}
```

</div>
<div data-language="Render Props (JavaScript)">

```jsx
const GET_TODOS = gql`
  query GetTodos {
    todos
  }
`;

const AddTodo = () => {
  let input;

  return (
    <Mutation
      mutation={ADD_TODO}
      update={(cache, { data: { addTodo } }) => {
        const { todos } = cache.readQuery({ query: GET_TODOS });
        cache.writeQuery({
          query: GET_TODOS,
          data: { todos: todos.concat([addTodo]) },
        });
      }}
    >
      {addTodo => (
        <div>
          <form
            onSubmit={e => {
              e.preventDefault();
              addTodo({ variables: { type: input.value } });
              input.value = '';
            }}
          >
            <input
              ref={node => {
                input = node;
              }}
            />
            <button type="submit">Add Todo</button>
          </form>
        </div>
      )}
    </Mutation>
  );
};
```

</div>
</MultiCodeBlock>

You can pass the `update` function as an option to `useMutation` or as an option to the mutate function (`addTodo` in this example). Since we need to update the query that displays a list of todos, first we read the data from the cache with `cache.readQuery`. Then, we concatenate our new todo from our mutation with the list of existing todos and write the query back to the cache with `cache.writeQuery`. Now that we've specified an update function, our UI will update reactively with the new todo once it comes back from the server.

Not every mutation requires an update function. If you're updating a single item, you usually don't need an update function as long as you return the item's `id` and the property you updated. While this may seem like magic, this is actually a benefit of Apollo's normalized cache, which splits out each object with an `id` into its own entity in the cache. Let's look at an example:

<MultiCodeBlock>
<div data-language="Hooks (JavaScript)">

```jsx
const UPDATE_TODO = gql`
  mutation UpdateTodo($id: String!, $type: String!) {
    updateTodo(id: $id, type: $type) {
      id
      type
    }
  }
`;

function Todos() {
  const { loading, error, data } = useQuery(GET_TODOS);
  const [updateTodo] = useMutation(UPDATE_TODO);

  if (loading) return <p>Loading...</p>;
  if (error) return <p>Error :(</p>;

  return data.todos.map(({ id, type }) => {
    let input;

    return (
      <div key={id}>
        <p>{type}</p>
        <form
          onSubmit={e => {
            e.preventDefault();
            updateTodo({ variables: { id, type: input.value } });

            input.value = '';
          }}
        >
          <input
            ref={node => {
              input = node;
            }}
          />
          <button type="submit">Update Todo</button>
        </form>
      </div>
    );
  });
}
```

</div>
<div data-language="Render Props (JavaScript)">

```jsx
const UPDATE_TODO = gql`
  mutation UpdateTodo($id: String!, $type: String!) {
    updateTodo(id: $id, type: $type) {
      id
      type
    }
  }
`;

const Todos = () => (
  <Query query={GET_TODOS}>
    {({ loading, error, data }) => {
      if (loading) return <p>Loading...</p>;
      if (error) return <p>Error :(</p>;

      return data.todos.map(({ id, type }) => {
        let input;

        return (
          <Mutation mutation={UPDATE_TODO} key={id}>
            {updateTodo => (
              <div>
                <p>{type}</p>
                <form
                  onSubmit={e => {
                    e.preventDefault();
                    updateTodo({ variables: { id, type: input.value } });

                    input.value = '';
                  }}
                >
                  <input
                    ref={node => {
                      input = node;
                    }}
                  />
                  <button type="submit">Update Todo</button>
                </form>
              </div>
            )}
          </Mutation>
        );
      });
    }}
  </Query>
);
```

</div>
</MultiCodeBlock>

If you try updating a todo, you'll notice that the UI updates immediately. Even though we don't plan on using the mutation return result in our UI, we still need to return the `id` and the property we updated in order for our UI to update reactively. Here, we don't need to specify an update function since the todos query will automatically reconstruct the query result with the updated todo's entry in the cache. If you'd like to dive deeper into the Apollo cache's normalization strategy, check out our advanced [caching guide](/advanced/caching/).

## Loading and error state

How do we know that our mutation has completed? What happens when your mutation doesn't complete successfully? We need a way to track loading and error state. Luckily, the `useMutation` hook allows you to do just that. Let's look at the `Todos` component from the previous example:

<MultiCodeBlock>
<div data-language="Hooks (JavaScript)">

```jsx
function Todos() {
  const { loading: queryLoading, error: queryError, data } = useQuery(
    GET_TODOS,
  );

  const [
    updateTodo,
    { loading: mutationLoading, error: mutationError },
  ] = useMutation(UPDATE_TODO);

  if (queryLoading) return <p>Loading...</p>;
  if (queryError) return <p>Error :(</p>;

  return data.todos.map(({ id, type }) => {
    let input;

    return (
      <div key={id}>
        <p>{type}</p>
        <form
          onSubmit={e => {
            e.preventDefault();
            updateTodo({ variables: { id, type: input.value } });

            input.value = '';
          }}
        >
          <input
            ref={node => {
              input = node;
            }}
          />
          <button type="submit">Update Todo</button>
        </form>
        {mutationLoading && <p>Loading...</p>}
        {mutationError && <p>Error :( Please try again</p>}
      </div>
    );
  });
}
```

</div>
<div data-language="Render Props (JavaScript)">

```jsx
const Todos = () => (
  <Query query={GET_TODOS}>
    {({ loading, error, data }) => {
      if (loading) return <p>Loading...</p>;
      if (error) return <p>Error :(</p>;

      return data.todos.map(({ id, type }) => {
        let input;

        return (
          <Mutation mutation={UPDATE_TODO} key={id}>
            {(updateTodo, { loading, error }) => (
              <div>
                <p>{type}</p>
                <form
                  onSubmit={e => {
                    e.preventDefault();
                    updateTodo({ variables: { id, type: input.value } });

                    input.value = '';
                  }}
                >
                  <input
                    ref={node => {
                      input = node;
                    }}
                  />
                  <button type="submit">Update Todo</button>
                </form>
                {loading && <p>Loading...</p>}
                {error && <p>Error :( Please try again</p>}
              </div>
            )}
          </Mutation>
        );
      });
    }}
  </Query>
);
```

</div>
</MultiCodeBlock>

We can destructure `loading` and `error` properties off the mutation result returned by `useMutation`, in order to track the state of our mutation in our UI. The `useMutation` hook also supports `onCompleted` and `onError` options in case you would like to provide callbacks instead. Additionally, the mutation result object also has a `called` boolean that tracks whether or not the mutate function has been called.

## useMutation API overview

If you're looking for an overview of all the options `useMutation` accepts, and its result properties, look no further! Most `useMutation` calls will not need all of these configuration options, but it's useful to know that they exist. If you'd like to learn about the `useMutation` hook API in more detail with usage examples, visit our [reference guide](/api/react-hooks/).

> **Note:** If you're using React Apollo's `Mutation` render prop component, the option/result details listed below are still valid (options are component props and results are passed into the render prop function). The only difference is that a `mutation` prop (which holds a GraphQL mutation document parsed into an AST by `graphql-tag`) is also required.

<h3>Options</h3>

The `useMutation` hook accepts the following options.

<MutationOptions />

<h3>Result</h3>

The `useMutation` result is a tuple with a `mutate` function in the first position, and an object with the mutation result in the second position. The `mutate` function is how you trigger the mutation from your UI. The object contains your mutation result, plus loading and error state.

<MutationResult />

## Next steps

Learning how to leverage the `useMutation` hook to update your data is an important part of developing applications with Apollo Client. Now that you're well-versed in updating data, why not try executing client-side mutations with Apollo Client's integrated local state management functionality? Here are some resources we think will help you level up your skills:

- [Optimistic UI](/features/optimistic-ui/): Learn how to improve perceived performance by returning an optimistic response before your mutation result comes back from the server.
- [Local state](/essentials/local-state/): Manage your local state with Apollo by executing client-side mutations.
- [Caching in Apollo](/advanced/caching/): Dive deep into the Apollo cache and how it's normalized in our advanced guide on caching. Understanding the cache is helpful when writing your mutation's `update` function!

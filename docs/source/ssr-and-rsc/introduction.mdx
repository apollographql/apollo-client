title: Server-Side Rendering and React Server Components - Introduction

# Disambiguation of essential terms

When discussing Server-Side Rendering (SSR) and React Server Components (RSC), it's necessary to understand the distinction between classic SSR and the modern approaches used in frameworks like Next.js.

- **Classic SSR**, typically executed using React's `renderToString`, involves rendering the entire React component tree on the server into a static HTML string, which is then sent to the browser.
  First, your React tree will render one or multiple times to start all network requests your page needs to render successfully.
  Once all these network requests have finished, one final render pass will generate the HTML sent to the browser.
  Only after that can that HTML be transported to the Browser, where a hydration pass has to happen before the page becomes interactive, often leading to a delay before interactive elements become functional.
  This approach is explained in the "Classic Server-side rendering with `renderToString`" section.

- Modern **streaming SSR** utilizes React Suspense with the `renderToReadableStream` and `renderToPipeableStream` APIs, which support streaming HTML to the browser as soon as suspendse boundaries are ready.
  This approach is more efficient, improving Time to Interactive (TTI) by allowing users to see and interact with content as it streams in rather than waiting for the entire bundle.
  When the term **SSR** is used outside the "Classic SSR" section, it refers to streaming SSR of React "Client Components".

- React Server Components (**RSC**) describe an - also streamed - render pass that happens before SSR, and only creates static JSX, which will be rendered into static HTML and is not rehydrated with interactive Components in the browser.
  A router can replace the RSC contents of a page by re-initializing an RSC render on the RSC server, and replace the static HTML of the page with the new RSC contents, while leaving interactive React Client Components intact.

- React **Client Components** are the interactive components that React has been known for the longest time of its existence, rendered either in SSR or after hydration directly in the browser.
  You can read more on how React "draws the line" between Client and Server Components in the [React documentation](https://react.dev/reference/react/use-client)

Generally, most custom implementations will use classic SSR, while frameworks like Next.js and Remix might use streaming SSR and RSC. It is possible to use streaming SSR in a manual setup, but at this point, it still requires a lot of setup. Using RSC without a framework is generally not recommended.

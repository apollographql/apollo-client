This article describes best practices for testing React components that use Apollo Client.

The examples below use [Jest](https://facebook.github.io/jest/docs/en/tutorial-react.html) and React's [test renderer](https://reactjs.org/docs/test-renderer.html) instead of tools like [Enzyme](https://github.com/airbnb/enzyme) or [react-testing-library](https://github.com/kentcdodds/react-testing-library), but the concepts apply to any testing framework.

## The `MockedProvider` component

Every test for a React component that uses Apollo Client must make Apollo Client available on [React's context](https://reactjs.org/docs/context.html). In application code, you achieve this by wrapping your component tree with the `ApolloProvider` component. In your tests, you use the `MockedProvider` component instead.

The `MockedProvider` component enables you to define mock responses for individual queries that are executed in your test. This means your test _doesn't_ need to communicate with a GraphQL server, which removes an external dependency and therefore improves the test's reliability.

### Example

Let's say we want to test the following `Dog` component, which executes a basic query and displays its result:

<ExpansionPanel title="Click to expand 🐶">

```jsx:title=dog.jsx
import React from 'react';
import { gql, useQuery } from '@apollo/client';

// Make sure that both the query and the component are exported
export const GET_DOG_QUERY = gql`
  query GetDog($name: String) {
    dog(name: $name) {
      id
      name
      breed
    }
  }
`;

export function Dog({ name }) {
  const { loading, error, data } = useQuery(
    GET_DOG_QUERY,
    { variables: { name } }
  );
  if (loading) return <p>Loading...</p>;
  if (error) return <p>Error!</p>;

  return (
    <p>
      {data.dog.name} is a {data.dog.breed}
    </p>
  );
}
```

</ExpansionPanel>

A basic rendering test for the component looks like this (minus mocked responses):

```jsx:title=dog.test.js
import TestRenderer from 'react-test-renderer';
import { MockedProvider } from '@apollo/client/testing';
import { GET_DOG_QUERY, Dog } from './dog';

const mocks = []; // We'll fill this in next

it('renders without error', () => {
  const component = TestRenderer.create(
    <MockedProvider mocks={mocks} addTypename={false}>
      <Dog name="Buck" />
    </MockedProvider>,
  );

  const tree = component.toJSON();
  expect(tree.children).toContain('Loading...');
});
```

#### Defining mocked responses

The `mocks` prop of `MockedProvider` is an array of objects, each of which defines the mock response for a single operation. Let's define a mocked response for `GET_DOG_QUERY` when it's passed the `name` `Buck`:

```jsx:title=dog.test.js
const mocks = [
  {
    request: {
      query: GET_DOG_QUERY,
      variables: {
        name: 'Buck',
      },
    },
    result: {
      data: {
        dog: { id: '1', name: 'Buck', breed: 'bulldog' },
      },
    },
  },
];
```

Each mock object defines a `request` field (indicating the shape and variables of the operation to match against) and a `result` field (indicating the shape of the response to return for that operation).

> **Your test must execute an operation that _exactly_ matches a mock's shape _and_ variables to receive the associated mocked response.**

Alternatively, the `result` field can be a function that returns a mocked response after performing arbitrary logic:

```jsx
result: () => {
  // ...arbitrary logic...

  return {
    data: {
      dog: { id: '1', name: 'Buck', breed: 'bulldog' },
    },
  }
},
```

Combining our code above, we get the following complete test:

<ExpansionPanel title="Click to expand 🐶">

```jsx:title=dog.test.js
import TestRenderer from 'react-test-renderer';
import { MockedProvider } from '@apollo/client/testing';
import { GET_DOG_QUERY, Dog } from './dog';

const mocks = [
  {
    request: {
      query: GET_DOG_QUERY,
      variables: {
        name: 'Buck',
      },
    },
    result: {
      data: {
        dog: { id: '1', name: 'Buck', breed: 'bulldog' },
      },
    },
  },
];

it('renders without error', () => {
  const component = TestRenderer.create(
    <MockedProvider mocks={mocks} addTypename={false}>
      <Dog name="Buck" />
    </MockedProvider>,
  );

  const tree = component.toJSON();
  expect(tree.children).toContain('Loading...');
});
```

</ExpansionPanel>

> **Important:** As it's written, this test checks whether the `Dog` component renders successfully and displays a `Loading...` message. However, it _doesn't_ wait for `MockedProvider` to respond to `GET_DOG_QUERY`. Even when GraphQL operations are mocked, they're `Promise`-based and therefore asynchronous. Because of this, this test always completes while the component is still in its initial [loading state](#testing-the-loading-state).
>
> To test a component's rendering _after_ `MockedProvider` responds, see [The "completed" state](#testing-the-success-state) and [Error states](#testing-error-states).

### Setting `addTypename`

In the example above, we set the `addTypename` prop of `MockedProvider` to `false`. This prevents Apollo Client from automatically adding the special `__typename` field to every object it queries for (it does this by default to support data normalization in the cache).

We _don't_ want to automatically add `__typename` to `GET_DOG_QUERY` in our test, because then it won't match the shape of the query that our mock is expecting.

Unless you explicitly configure your mocks to expect a `__typename` field, always set `addTypename` to `false` in your tests.

## Testing the "loading" state

You can test how your component is rendered while it's still awaiting a query result. In fact, this is a test's default behavior if it doesn't _explicitly_ wait for the `Promise`-based result from `MockedProvider`.

[The example above](#example) shows a test that renders a component in its "loading" state without awaiting a result from `MockedProvider`.

## Testing the "success" state

To test how your component is rendered after its query completes, you can `await` a zero-millisecond timeout before performing your checks. This delays the checks until the next "tick" of the event loop, which gives `MockedProvider` an opportunity to populate the mocked result:

```jsx
it('should render dog', async () => {
  const dogMock = {
    request: {
      query: GET_DOG_QUERY,
      variables: { name: 'Buck' },
    },
    result: {
      data: { dog: { id: 1, name: 'Buck', breed: 'poodle' } },
    },
  };

  const component = TestRenderer.create(
    <MockedProvider mocks={[dogMock]} addTypename={false}>
      <Dog name="Buck" />
    </MockedProvider>,
  );

  await new Promise(resolve => setTimeout(resolve, 0)); // highlight-line

  const p = component.root.findByType('p');
  expect(p.children.join('')).toContain('Buck is a poodle');
});
```

If your component performs complex calculations or includes delays in its render logic, you can increase the timeout's duration accordingly. You can also use a package like [`wait-for-expect`](https://npm.im/wait-for-expect) to delay until the render has occurred. The risk of using a package like this everywhere is that _every_ test might take up to five seconds to execute (or longer if the default timeout is increased).

## Testing error states

Your component's error states are just as important to test as its success state, if not more so. You can use the `MockedProvider` component to simulate both network errors and GraphQL errors.

* Network errors are errors that occur while your client attempts to communicate with your GraphQL server.
* GraphQL errors are errors that occur while your GraphQL server attempts to resolve your client's operation.

> Tests for error states require the same zero-millisecond timeout as [tests for the success state](#testing-the-success-state).

### Network errors

To simulate a network error, you can include an `error` field in your test's mock object, instead of the `result` field:

```jsx
it('should show error UI', async () => {
  const dogMock = {
    request: {
      query: GET_DOG_QUERY,
      variables: { name: 'Buck' },
    },
    error: new Error('An error occurred'),
  };

  const component = TestRenderer.create(
    <MockedProvider mocks={[dogMock]} addTypename={false}>
      <Dog name="Buck" />
    </MockedProvider>,
  );

  await new Promise(resolve => setTimeout(resolve, 0)); // wait for response

  const tree = component.toJSON();
  expect(tree.children).toContain('An error occurred');
});
```

In this case, when the `Dog` component executes its query, the `MockedProvider` returns the corresponding error. This applies the error state to our `Dog` component, enabling us to verify that the error is handled gracefully.

### GraphQL errors

To simulate GraphQL errors, you define an `errors` field _inside_ a mock's `result` field. The value of this field is an array of instantiated `GraphQLError` objects:

```js
const dogMock = {
  // ...
  result: {
    errors: [new GraphQLError('Error!')],
  },
};
```

Because GraphQL supports returning partial results when an error occurs, a mock object's `result` can include both `errors` _and_ `data`.

## Testing mutations

You test components that use `useMutation` similarly to how you test components that use `useQuery`. Just like in your application code, the primary _difference_ is that you need to call the mutation's **mutate function** to actually execute the operation.

### Example

The following `DeleteButton` component executes the `DELETE_DOG_MUTATION` to delete a dog named `Buck` from our data graph (don't worry, Buck will be fine 🐶):

```jsx:title=delete-dog.jsx
export const DELETE_DOG_MUTATION = gql`
  mutation deleteDog($name: String!) {
    deleteDog(name: $name) {
      id
      name
      breed
    }
  }
`;

export function DeleteButton() {
  const [mutate, { loading, error, data }] = useMutation(DELETE_DOG_MUTATION);

  if (loading) return <p>Loading...</p>;
  if (error) return <p>Error!</p>;
  if (data) return <p>Deleted!</p>;

  return (
    <button onClick={() => mutate({ variables: { name: 'Buck' } })}>
      Click to Delete Buck
    </button>
  );
}
```

We can test the initial rendering of this component just like we [tested our `Dog` component](#example):

```jsx:title=delete-dog.test.js
import TestRenderer from 'react-test-renderer';
import { MockedProvider } from '@apollo/client/testing';
import DeleteButton, { DELETE_DOG_MUTATION } from './delete-dog';

it('should render without error', () => {
  TestRenderer.create(
    <MockedProvider mocks={[]}>
      <DeleteButton />
    </MockedProvider>,
  );
});
```

In the test above, `DELETE_DOG_MUTATION` is _not_ executed, because the mutate function is not called.

The following test _does_ execute the mutation by clicking the button:

```jsx:title=delete-dog.test.js
it('should render loading state initially', () => {
  const deleteDog = { name: 'Buck', breed: 'Poodle', id: 1 };
  const mocks = [
    {
      request: {
        query: DELETE_DOG_MUTATION,
        variables: { name: 'Buck' },
      },
      result: { data: { deleteDog } },
    },
  ];

  const component = TestRenderer.create(
    <MockedProvider mocks={mocks} addTypename={false}>
      <DeleteButton />
    </MockedProvider>,
  );

  // find the button and simulate a click
  const button = component.root.findByType('button');
  button.props.onClick(); // fires the mutation

  const tree = component.toJSON();
  expect(tree.children).toContain('Loading...');
});
```

Again, this example is similar to [the `useQuery`-based component above](#example), but it differs after the rendering is completed. Because this component relies on a button click to fire a mutation, we use the renderer's API to find the button and simulate a click with its `onClick` handler. This fires off the mutation, and the rest of the test runs as expected.

> Other test utilities like [Enzyme](https://github.com/airbnb/enzyme) and [react-testing-library](https://github.com/kentcdodds/react-testing-library) have built-in tools for finding elements and simulating events, but the concept is the same: find the button and simulate a click on it.

To test for a successful mutation after simulating the click, use a zero-millisecond timeout, as shown in [Testing the "success" state](#testing-the-success-state):

<ExpansionPanel title="Click to expand 🐶">

```jsx
import TestRenderer from 'react-test-renderer';
import { MockedProvider } from '@apollo/client/testing';
import DeleteButton, { DELETE_DOG_MUTATION } from './delete-dog';

it('should delete and give visual feedback', async () => {
  const deleteDog = { name: 'Buck', breed: 'Poodle', id: 1 };
  const mocks = [
    {
      request: {
        query: DELETE_DOG_MUTATION,
        variables: { name: 'Buck' },
      },
      result: { data: { deleteDog } },
    },
  ];

  const component = TestRenderer.create(
    <MockedProvider mocks={mocks} addTypename={false}>
      <DeleteButton />
    </MockedProvider>,
  );

  // find the button and simulate a click
  const button = component.root.findByType('button');
  button.props.onClick(); // fires the mutation

  await new Promise(resolve => setTimeout(resolve, 0)); // wait for response

  const tree = component.toJSON();
  expect(tree.children).toContain('Deleted!');
});
```

</ExpansionPanel>

Remember that the mock's value for `result` can also be a function, so you can perform arbitrary logic (like setting a boolean to indicate that the mutation completed) before returning its result.

[Testing error states](#testing-error-states) for mutations is identical to testing them for queries..

## Testing with the cache

If your application sets any [cache configuration options](../caching/cache-configuration/#configuration-options) (such as `possibleTypes` or `typePolicies`), you should provide `MockedProvider` with an instance of `InMemoryCache` that sets the exact same options:

```jsx
const cache = new InMemoryCache({
  // ...configuration options...
})

<MockedProvider mocks={mocks} cache={cache}>
  <DeleteButton />
</MockedProvider>,
```

The following sample specifies `possibleTypes` and `typePolicies` in its cache configuration, both of which must also be specified in relevant tests to prevent unexpected behavior.

<ExpansionPanel title="Click to expand 🐶">

```jsx
// "Dog" supertype can be of type "ShibaInu"
const ShibaFragment = gql`
  fragment ShibaInuFields on Dog {
    ... on ShibaInu {
      tail {
        isCurly
      }
    }
  }
`;

export const GET_DOG_QUERY = gql`
  query GetDog($name: String) {
    dog(name: $name) {
      id
      name
      breed

      ...ShibaInuFields
    }
  }

  ${ShibaFragment}
`;

export const cache = new ApolloClient({
  cache: new InMemoryCache({
    possibleTypes: {
      Dog: ['ShibaInu']
    },
    // suppose you want you key fields for "Dog" to not be simply "id"
    typePolicies: {
      keyFields: {
        Dog: ['name', 'breed']
      }
    }
  })
})
```

</ExpansionPanel>

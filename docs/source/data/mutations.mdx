import MutationOptions from '../../shared/mutation-options.mdx';
import MutationResult from '../../shared/mutation-result.mdx';

Now that we've [learned how to fetch data](queries/) from our backend with Apollo Client,
the natural next step is to learn how to update that data with **mutations**.
This article demonstrates how to send updates to your GraphQL server with the
`useMutation` hook. You'll also learn how to update the Apollo Client cache
after executing a mutation, and how to track loading and error states for a mutation.

## Prerequisites

This article assumes you're familiar with building basic GraphQL mutations. If you need a refresher, we recommend that you
[read this guide](http://graphql.org/learn/queries/#mutations).

This article also assumes that you've already set up Apollo Client and have wrapped your React app in an `ApolloProvider` component. Read our [getting started guide](../get-started/) if you need help with either of those steps.

> To follow along with the examples below, open up our [starter project](https://codesandbox.io/s/mutations-example-app-start-gm7i5) and [sample GraphQL server](https://codesandbox.io/s/mutations-example-app-server-sxewr) on CodeSandbox. You can view the completed version of the app [here](https://codesandbox.io/s/mutations-example-app-final-tjoje).

## Executing a mutation

The `useMutation` [React hook](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-intro.html) is the primary API for executing mutations in an Apollo application. To run a mutation, you first call `useMutation` within a React component and pass it a GraphQL string that represents the mutation. When your component renders, `useMutation` returns a tuple that includes:

* A **mutate function** that you can call at any time to execute the mutation
* An object with fields that represent the current status of the mutation's execution

Let's look at an example. First, we'll create a GraphQL mutation named `ADD_TODO`, which represents adding an item to a to-do list. Remember to wrap GraphQL strings in the `gql` function to parse them into query documents:

```jsx
import { gql, useMutation } from '@apollo/client';

const ADD_TODO = gql`
  mutation AddTodo($type: String!) {
    addTodo(type: $type) {
      id
      type
    }
  }
`;
```

Next, we'll create a component named `AddTodo` that represents the submission form for the to-do list. Inside it, we'll pass our
`ADD_TODO` mutation to the `useMutation` hook:

```jsx:title=index.js
function AddTodo() {
  let input;
  const [addTodo, { data }] = useMutation(ADD_TODO);

  return (
    <div>
      <form
        onSubmit={e => {
          e.preventDefault();
          addTodo({ variables: { type: input.value } });
          input.value = '';
        }}
      >
        <input
          ref={node => {
            input = node;
          }}
        />
        <button type="submit">Add Todo</button>
      </form>
    </div>
  );
}
```

### Calling the mutate function

The `useMutation` hook does _not_ automatically execute the mutation you
pass it when the component renders. Instead, it returns a tuple with a **mutate function** in its first position (which we assign to `addTodo` in the example above). You then call the mutate function
at any time to instruct Apollo Client to execute the mutation. In the example above, we call `addTodo` when the user submits the form.

### Providing options

Both `useMutation` itself and the mutate function accept options that are described in the [API reference](../api/react/hooks/#usemutation). Any options you provide to a mutate function _override_ corresponding options
you previously provided to `useMutation`. In the example above, we provide the
`variables` option to `addTodo`, which enables us to specify any GraphQL variables that the mutation requires.


### Tracking mutation status

In addition to a mutate function, the `useMutation` hook returns an object that
represents the current state of the mutation's execution. The fields of this
object (fully documented in the [API reference](../api/react/hooks/)) include booleans that indicate whether the mutate function has been `called` yet, and whether the mutation's result is currently `loading`.

## Updating the cache after a mutation

When you execute a mutation, you modify back-end data. If that data
is also present in your [Apollo Client cache](../caching/cache-configuration/),
you might need to update your cache to reflect the result of the mutation.
This depends on whether the mutation _updates a single existing entity_.

### Updating a single existing entity

If a mutation updates a single existing entity, Apollo Client can automatically
update that entity's value in its cache when the mutation returns. To do so,
the mutation must return the `id` of the modified entity, along with the values
of the fields that were modified. Conveniently, mutations do this by default in
Apollo Client.

Let's look at an example that enables us to modify the value of any existing
item in our to-do list:

```jsx
const UPDATE_TODO = gql`
  mutation UpdateTodo($id: String!, $type: String!) {
    updateTodo(id: $id, type: $type) {
      id
      type
    }
  }
`;

function Todos() {
  const { loading, error, data } = useQuery(GET_TODOS);
  const [updateTodo] = useMutation(UPDATE_TODO);

  if (loading) return <p>Loading...</p>;
  if (error) return <p>Error :(</p>;

  return data.todos.map(({ id, type }) => {
    let input;

    return (
      <div key={id}>
        <p>{type}</p>
        <form
          onSubmit={e => {
            e.preventDefault();
            updateTodo({ variables: { id, type: input.value } });
            input.value = '';
          }}
        >
          <input
            ref={node => {
              input = node;
            }}
          />
          <button type="submit">Update Todo</button>
        </form>
      </div>
    );
  });
}
```

If you execute the `UPDATE_TODO` mutation using this component, the mutation
returns both the `id` of the modified to-do item and the item's new `type`.
Because Apollo Client caches entities by `id`, it knows how to automatically
update the corresponding entity in its cache. The application's UI also updates
immediately to reflect changes in the cache.

### Making all other cache updates

If a mutation modifies multiple entities, or if it creates or deletes entities, the Apollo Client cache is _not_ automatically updated to reflect the result of the
mutation. To resolve this, your call to `useMutation` can include an **update function**.

The purpose of an update function is to modify your _cached_ data to
match the modifications that a mutation makes to your _back-end_
data. In the example in [Executing a mutation](#executing-a-mutation), the
update function for the `ADD_TODO` mutation should add the same item to our
cached version of the to-do list.

The following sample illustrates defining an update function in a call to `useMutation`:

```jsx
const GET_TODOS = gql`
  query GetTodos {
    todos {
      id
    }
  }
`;

function AddTodo() {
  let input;
  const [addTodo] = useMutation(ADD_TODO, {
    update(cache, { data: { addTodo } }) {
      cache.modify({
        fields: {
          todos(existingTodos = []) {
            const newTodoRef = cache.writeFragment({
              data: addTodo,
              fragment: gql`
                fragment NewTodo on Todo {
                  id
                  type
                }
              `
            });
            return [...existingTodos, newTodoRef];
          }
        }
      });
    }
  });

  return (
    <div>
      <form
        onSubmit={e => {
          e.preventDefault();
          addTodo({ variables: { type: input.value } });
          input.value = "";
        }}
      >
        <input
          ref={node => {
            input = node;
          }}
        />
        <button type="submit">Add Todo</button>
      </form>
    </div>
  );
}
```

As shown, the update function is passed a `cache` object that represents the Apollo Client cache. This object provides access to cache API methods like `readQuery`, `writeQuery`, `readFragment`, `writeFragment` and `modify`. These methods enable you to execute GraphQL operations on the cache as though you're interacting with a GraphQL server.

> Learn more about supported cache functions in [Interacting with cached data](../caching/cache-interaction/).

The update function is _also_ passed an object with a `data` property that contains the result of the mutation. You can use this value to update the cache with `cache.writeQuery`, `cache.writeFragment` or `cache.modify`.

> If your mutation specifies an [optimistic response](../performance/optimistic-ui/), your update function is called **twice**: once with the optimistic result, and again with the actual result of the mutation when it returns.

When the `ADD_TODO` mutation is run in the above example, the newly added and returned todo object is saved into the cache. The previously cached list of todos, being watched by the `GET_TODOS` query, is not automatically updated however. This means the `GET_TODOS` query isn't notified that a new todo was added, which then means the query will not update to show the new todo. To address this we're using `cache.modify` which gives us a way to surgically insert or delete items from the cache, by running modifier functions. In the example above we know the results of the `GET_TODOS` query are stored in the `ROOT_QUERY.todos` array in the cache, so we're using a `todos` modifier function to update the cached array to include a reference to the newly added todo. With the help of `cache.writeFragment` we get an internal reference to the added todo, then store that reference in the `ROOT_QUERY.todos` array.

Any changes you make to cached data inside of an update function are automatically broadcast to queries that are listening for changes to that data. Consequently, your application's UI will update to reflect newly cached values.

## Tracking loading and error states

The `useMutation` hook provides mechanisms for tracking the loading and error
state of a mutation.

Let's revisit the `Todos` component from [Updating a single existing entity](#updating-a-single-existing-entity):

```jsx
function Todos() {
  const { loading: queryLoading, error: queryError, data } = useQuery(
    GET_TODOS,
  );

  const [
    updateTodo,
    { loading: mutationLoading, error: mutationError },
  ] = useMutation(UPDATE_TODO);

  if (queryLoading) return <p>Loading...</p>;
  if (queryError) return <p>Error :(</p>;

  return data.todos.map(({ id, type }) => {
    let input;

    return (
      <div key={id}>
        <p>{type}</p>
        <form
          onSubmit={e => {
            e.preventDefault();
            updateTodo({ variables: { id, type: input.value } });
            input.value = '';
          }}
        >
          <input
            ref={node => {
              input = node;
            }}
          />
          <button type="submit">Update Todo</button>
        </form>
        {mutationLoading && <p>Loading...</p>}
        {mutationError && <p>Error :( Please try again</p>}
      </div>
    );
  });
}
```

As shown above, we can destructure the `loading` and `error` properties from
the result object returned by `useMutation` to track the mutation's state in our UI. The `useMutation` hook also supports `onCompleted` and `onError` options if you prefer to use callbacks.

Learn about all of the fields returned by `useMutation` in the [API reference](../api/react/hooks/).

## `useMutation` API

Supported options and result fields for the `useMutation` hook are listed below.

Most calls to `useMutation` can omit the majority of these options, but it's
useful to know they exist. To learn about the `useMutation` hook API in more
detail with usage examples, see the [API reference](../api/react/hooks/).

### Options

The `useMutation` hook accepts the following options:

<MutationOptions />

### Result

The `useMutation` result is a tuple with a mutate function in the first position and an object representing the mutation result in the second position.

You call the mutate function to trigger the mutation from your UI.

<MutationResult />

## Next steps

The `useQuery` and `useMutation` hooks together represent Apollo Client's core
API for performing GraphQL operations. Now that you're familiar with both,
you can begin to take advantage of Apollo Client's full feature set, including:

- [Optimistic UI](../performance/optimistic-ui/): Learn how to improve perceived performance by returning an optimistic response before your mutation result comes back from the server.
- [Local state](../local-state/local-state-management/): Use Apollo Client to manage the entirety of your application's local state by executing client-side mutations.
- [Caching in Apollo](../caching/cache-configuration/): Dive deep into the Apollo Client cache and how it's normalized. Understanding the cache is helpful when writing update functions for your mutations!

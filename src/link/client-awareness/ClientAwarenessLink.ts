/**
 * `ClientAwarenessLink` provides support for providing client awareness
 * features.
 *
 * @remarks
 *
 * Client awareness adds identifying information about the client to HTTP
 * requests for use with metrics reporting tools, such as [Apollo GraphOS](https://apollographql.com/docs/graphos/platform).
 * It is included in the functionality of [`HttpLink`](https://apollographql.com/docs/react/api/link/apollo-link-http) by default.
 *
 * Client awareness distinguishes between user-provided client awareness
 * (provided by the `clientAwareness` option) and enhanced client awareness
 * (provided by the `enhancedClientAwareness` option). User-provided client
 * awareness enables you to set a customized client name and version for
 * identification in metrics reporting tools. Enhanced client awareness enables
 * the identification of the Apollo Client package name and version.
 *
 * @example
 *
 * ```ts
 * import { ClientAwarenessLink } from "@apollo/client/link/client-awareness";
 *
 * const link = new ClientAwarenessLink({
 *   clientAwareness: {
 *     name: "My Client",
 *     version: "1",
 *   },
 *   enhancedClientAwareness: {
 *     transport: "extensions",
 *   },
 * });
 * ```

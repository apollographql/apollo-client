Apollo Client allows you to make local modifications to your GraphQL data by [updating the cache](./mutations/#updating-the-cache-directly), but sometimes it's more straightforward to update your client-side GraphQL data by refetching queries from the server.

In theory, you could refetch _every_ active query after a client-side update, but you can save time and network bandwidth by refetching queries more selectively. The `InMemoryCache` helps you determine _which_ active queries might have been invalidated by recent cache updates.

Local cache updates and refetching work especially well in combination: your application can display the results of local cache modifications immediately, while _also_ refetching in the background to obtain the very latest data from the server. The UI is then rerendered only if there are differences between local data and refetched data.

Refetching is especially common after a mutation, so [mutate functions](./mutations/#executing-a-mutation) accept options like [`refetchQueries`](./mutations/#refetching-queries) and [`onQueryUpdated`](./mutations/#refetching-after-update) to specify which queries should be refetched, and how.

To selectively refetch queries _outside_ of a mutation, you instead use the `refetchQueries` method of `ApolloClient`, which is documented here.

## `client.refetchQueries`

> This method is new in Apollo Client 3.4.

### Refetch options

<RefetchQueriesOptions />

### Refetch results

The `client.refetchQueries` method collects the `TResult` results returned by `onQueryUpdated`, defaulting to `TResult = Promise<ApolloQueryResult<any>>` if `onQueryUpdated` is not provided. It combines those results into a single `Promise<TResolved[]>` using `Promise.all(results)`.

> Thanks to the `Promise`-unwrapping behavior of `Promise.all`, this `TResolved` type is often the same type as `TResult`, except when `TResult` is a `PromiseLike<TResolved>` or a `boolean`.

The returned `Promise` object has two other useful properties:

<table class="field-table api-ref">
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Name /<br/>Type</th>
      <th>Description</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>

<tr>
<td>

###### `queries`

`ObservableQuery[]`
</td>

<td>

An array of `ObservableQuery` objects that were refetched.

</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>

###### `results`

`TResult[]`
</td>

<td>

An array of results that were either returned by `onQueryUpdated`, or provided by default in the absence of `onQueryUpdated`, including pending promises.

If `onQueryUpdated` returns `false` for a given query, no result is provided for that query.

If `onQueryUpdated` returns `true`, the resulting `Promise<ApolloQueryResult<any>>` is included in the `results` array instead of `true`.

</td>
</tr>

</tbody>
</table>

These two arrays parallel each other: they have the same length, and `results[i]` is the result produced by `onQueryUpdated` when called with the `ObservableQuery` found at `queries[i]`, for any index `i`.

### Refetch recipes

#### Refetching a specific query

To refetch a specific query by name, use the `include` option by itself:

```ts
await client.refetchQueries({
  include: ["SomeQueryName"],
});
```

The `include` option can also refetch a specific query using its `DocumentNode`:

```ts
await client.refetchQueries({
  include: [SOME_QUERY],
});
```

#### Refetching all queries

To refetch all _active_ queries, pass the `"active"` shorthand for `include`:
```ts
await client.refetchQueries({
  include: "active",
});
```

To refetch _all_ queries managed by Apollo Client (even those with no observers, or whose components are currently unmounted), pass `"all"` for `include`:

```ts
await client.refetchQueries({
  include: "all", // Consider using "active" instead!
});
```

#### Refetching queries affected by cache updates

You can refetch queries affected by cache updates performed in the `updateCache` callback:

```ts
await client.refetchQueries({
  updateCache(cache) {
    cache.evict({ fieldName: "someRootField" });
  },
});
```

This refetches any queries that depend on `Query.someRootField`, without requiring you to know in advance which queries might be included. Any combination of cache operations (`writeQuery`, `writeFragment`, `modify`, `evict`, etc.) is allowed within `updateCache`.

Updates performed by `updateCache` persist in the cache by default. You can perform them in a temporary optimistic layer instead, if you want them to be discarded immediately after `client.refetchQueries` is done observing them, leaving the cache unchanged:

```ts
await client.refetchQueries({
  updateCache(cache) {
    cache.evict({ fieldName: "someRootField" });
  },

  // Evict Query.someRootField only temporarily, in an optimistic layer.
  optimistic: true,
});
```

Another way to "update" the cache without actually changing cache data is to use `cache.modify` and its `INVALIDATE` sentinel object:

```ts
await client.refetchQueries({
  updateCache(cache) {
    cache.modify({
      fields: {
        someRootField(value, { INVALIDATE }) {
          // Update queries that involve Query.someRootField, without actually
          // changing its value in the cache.
          return INVALIDATE;
        },
      },
    });
  },
});
```

> Before `client.refetchQueries` was introduced, the `INVALIDATE` sentinel was [not very useful](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-client/issues/7060#issuecomment-698026089), because invalidated queries with `fetchPolicy: "cache-first"` would typically re-read unchanged results, and therefore decide not to perform a network request. The `client.refetchQueries` method makes this invalidation system more accessible to application code, so you can control the refetching behavior of invalidated queries.

In all of the examples above, whether we use `include` or `updateCache`, `client.refetchQueries` refetches affected queries from the network and includes the resulting `Promise<ApolloQueryResult<any>>` results in the `Promise<TResolved[]>` returned by `client.refetchQueries`.

If a particular query is included both by `include` and by `updateCache`, that query is refetched only once. In other words, the `include` option is a good way to make sure certain queries are always included, no matter which queries are included by `updateCache`.

#### Refetching selectively

In development, you probably want to make sure the appropriate queries are getting refetched, rather than blindly refetching them. To intercept each query before refetching, you can specify an `onQueryUpdated` callback:

```ts
const results = await client.refetchQueries({
  updateCache(cache) {
    cache.evict({ fieldName: "someRootField" });
  },

  onQueryUpdated(observableQuery) {
    // Logging and/or debugger breakpoints can be useful in development to
    // understand what client.refetchQueries is doing.
    console.log(`Examining ObservableQuery ${observableQuery.queryName}`);
    debugger;

    // Proceed with the default refetching behavior, as if onQueryUpdated
    // was not provided.
    return true;
  },
});

results.forEach(result => {
  // These results will be ApolloQueryResult<any> objects, after all
  // results have been refetched from the network.
});
```

Notice how adding `onQueryUpdated` in this example did not change the refetching behavior of `client.refetchQueries`, allowing us to use `onQueryUpdated` purely for diagnostic or debugging purposes.

If you want to skip certain queries that would otherwise be included, return `false` from `onQueryUpdated`:

```ts
await client.refetchQueries({
  updateCache(cache) {
    cache.evict({ fieldName: "someRootField" });
  },

  onQueryUpdated(observableQuery) {
    console.log(`Examining ObservableQuery ${
      observableQuery.queryName
    } whose latest result is ${JSON.stringify(result)} which is ${
      complete ? "complete" : "incomplete"
    }`);

    if (shouldIgnoreQuery(observableQuery)) {
      return false;
    }

    // Refetch the query unconditionally from the network.
    return true;
  },
});
```

In case the `ObservableQuery` does not provide enough information, you can also examine the latest `result` for the query, along with information about its `complete`ness and `missing` fields, using the `Cache.DiffResult` object passed as the second parameter to `onQueryUpdated`:

```ts
await client.refetchQueries({
  updateCache(cache) {
    cache.evict({ fieldName: "someRootField" });
  },

  onQueryUpdated(observableQuery, { complete, result, missing }) {
    if (shouldIgnoreQuery(observableQuery)) {
      return false;
    }

    if (complete) {
      // Update the query according to its chosen FetchPolicy, rather than
      // refetching it unconditionally from the network.
      return observableQuery.reobserve();
    }

    // Refetch the query unconditionally from the network.
    return true;
  },
});
```

Because `onQueryUpdated` has the ability to filter queries dynamically, it also pairs well with the bulk `include` options mentioned above:

```ts
await client.refetchQueries({
  // Include all active queries by default, which may be ill-advised unless
  // you also use onQueryUpdated to filter those queries.
  include: "active";

  // Called once for every active query, allowing dynamic filtering:
  onQueryUpdated(observableQuery) {
    return !shouldIngoreQuery(observableQuery);
  },
});
```

#### Handling refetch errors

In the examples above, we `await client.refetchQueries(...)` to find out the final `ApolloQueryResult<any>` results for all the refetched queries. This combined promise is created with `Promise.all`, so a single failure rejects the entire `Promise<TResolved[]>`, potentially hiding other successful results. If this is a problem, you can use the `queries` and `results` arrays returned by
`client.refetchQueries` instead of (or in addition to) `await`ing the `Promise`:

```ts
const { queries, results } = client.refetchQueries({
  // Specific client.refetchQueries options are not relevant to this example.
});

const finalResults = await Promise.all(
  results.map((result, i) => {
    return Promise.resolve(result).catch(error => {
      console.error(`Error refetching query ${queries[i].queryName}: ${error}`);
      return null; // Silence this Promise rejection.
    });
  })
});
```

In the future, just as additional input options may be added to the `client.refetchQueries` method, additional properties may be added to its result object, supplementing its `Promise`-related properties and the `queries` and `results` arrays.

If you discover that some specific additional `client.refetchQueries` input options or result properties would be useful, please feel free to [open an issue](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-feature-requests/issues) or [start a discussion](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-client/discussions) explaining your use case(s).

### Corresponding `client.mutate` options

For refetching after a mutation, `client.mutate` supports [options](./mutations/#options) similar to `client.refetchQueries`, which you should use instead of `client.refetchQueries`, because it's important for refetching logic to happen at specific times during the mutation process.

For historical reasons, `client.mutate` options have slightly different names from the new `client.refetchQueries` options, but their internal implementation is substantially the same, so you can translate between them using the following table:

| `client.mutate(options)` | | `client.refetchQueries(options)` |
| - | - | - |
| [`options.refetchQueries`](./mutations/#refetching-queries) | ⇔ | `options.include` |
| [`options.update`](./mutations/#the-update-function) | ⇔ | `options.updateCache` |
| [`options.onQueryUpdated`](./mutations/#refetching-after-update) | ⇔ | `options.onQueryUpdated` |
| [`options.awaitRefetchQueries`](./mutations/#options) | ⇔ | Return a `Promise` from `onQueryUpdated` |

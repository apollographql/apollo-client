This article describes best practices for testing React components that use Apollo Client.

The examples below use [Jest](https://facebook.github.io/jest/docs/en/tutorial-react.html) and [React Testing Library](https://github.com/testing-library/react-testing-library), but the concepts apply to any testing framework.

## The `MockedProvider` component

Every test for a React component that uses Apollo Client must make Apollo Client available on [React's context](https://reactjs.org/docs/context.html). In application code, you achieve this by wrapping your component tree with the `ApolloProvider` component. In your tests, you use the `MockedProvider` component instead.

The `MockedProvider` component enables you to define mock responses for individual queries that are executed in your test. This means your test _doesn't_ need to communicate with a GraphQL server, which removes an external dependency and therefore improves the test's reliability.

### Example

Let's say we want to test the following `Dog` component, which executes a basic query and displays its result:

<ExpansionPanel title="Click to expand üê∂">

```jsx title="dog.jsx"
import React from "react";
import { gql, useQuery } from "@apollo/client";

// Make sure that both the query and the component are exported
export const GET_DOG_QUERY = gql`
  query GetDog($name: String) {
    dog(name: $name) {
      id
      name
      breed
    }
  }
`;

export function Dog({ name }) {
  const { loading, error, data } = useQuery(GET_DOG_QUERY, {
    variables: { name }
  });
  if (loading) return <p>Loading...</p>;
  if (error) return <p>{error.message}</p>;
  return (
    <p>
      {data.dog.name} is a {data.dog.breed}
    </p>
  );
}
```

</ExpansionPanel>

A basic rendering test for the component looks like this (minus mocked responses):

```jsx title="dog.test.js"
import "@testing-library/jest-dom";
import { render, screen } from "@testing-library/react";
import { MockedProvider } from "@apollo/client/testing";
import { GET_DOG_QUERY, Dog } from "./dog";

const mocks = []; // We'll fill this in next

it("renders without error", async () => {
  render(
    <MockedProvider mocks={mocks} addTypename={false}>
      <Dog name="Buck" />
    </MockedProvider>
  );
  expect(await screen.findByText("Loading...")).toBeInTheDocument();
});
```

> **Note:** Usually, you import `@testing-library/jest-dom` in your [test setup file](https://jestjs.io/docs/configuration), which provides certain [custom jest matchers](https://github.com/testing-library/jest-dom#custom-matchers) (such as `toBeInTheDocument`). The import is included in these examples for completeness.

#### Defining mocked responses

The `mocks` prop of `MockedProvider` is an array of objects, each of which defines the mock response for a single operation. Let's define a mocked response for `GET_DOG_QUERY` when it's passed the `name` `Buck`:

```jsx title="dog.test.js"
const mocks = [
  {
    request: {
      query: GET_DOG_QUERY,
      variables: {
        name: "Buck"
      }
    },
    result: {
      data: {
        dog: { id: "1", name: "Buck", breed: "bulldog" }
      }
    }
  }
];
```

Each mock object defines a `request` field (indicating the shape and variables of the operation to match against) and a `result` field (indicating the shape of the response to return for that operation).

> **Your test must execute an operation that _exactly_ matches a mock's shape _and_ variables to receive the associated mocked response.**

Alternatively, the `result` field can be a function that returns a mocked response after performing arbitrary logic:

```jsx
result: () => {
  // ...arbitrary logic...

  return {
    data: {
      dog: { id: '1', name: 'Buck', breed: 'bulldog' },
    },
  }
},
```

Combining our code above, we get the following complete test:

<ExpansionPanel title="Click to expand üê∂">

```jsx title="dog.test.js"
import "@testing-library/jest-dom";
import { render, screen } from "@testing-library/react";
import { MockedProvider } from "@apollo/client/testing";
import { GET_DOG_QUERY, Dog } from "./dog";

const mocks = [
  {
    request: {
      query: GET_DOG_QUERY,
      variables: {
        name: "Buck"
      }
    },
    result: {
      data: {
        dog: { id: "1", name: "Buck", breed: "bulldog" }
      }
    }
  }
];

it("renders without error", async () => {
  render(
    <MockedProvider mocks={mocks} addTypename={false}>
      <Dog name="Buck" />
    </MockedProvider>
  );
  expect(await screen.findByText("Loading...")).toBeInTheDocument();
});
```

</ExpansionPanel>

### Setting `addTypename`

In the example above, we set the `addTypename` prop of `MockedProvider` to `false`. This prevents Apollo Client from automatically adding the special `__typename` field to every object it queries for (it does this by default to support data normalization in the cache).

We _don't_ want to automatically add `__typename` to `GET_DOG_QUERY` in our test, because then it won't match the shape of the query that our mock is expecting.

Unless you explicitly configure your mocks to expect a `__typename` field, always set `addTypename` to `false` in your tests.

## Testing the "loading" and "success" states

To test how your component is rendered after its query completes, Testing Library provides several `findBy` methods. From the [Testing Library docs](https://testing-library.com/docs/dom-testing-library/api-async/#findby-queries):

> `findBy` queries work when you expect an element to appear but the change to the DOM might not happen immediately.

We can use the asynchronous `screen.findByText` method to query the DOM elements containing the loading message first, followed by the success message `"Buck is a poodle"` (which appears after our query completes):

```jsx
it("should render dog", async () => {
  const dogMock = {
    request: {
      query: GET_DOG_QUERY,
      variables: { name: "Buck" }
    },
    result: {
      data: { dog: { id: 1, name: "Buck", breed: "poodle" } }
    }
  };
  render(
    <MockedProvider mocks={[dogMock]} addTypename={false}>
      <Dog name="Buck" />
    </MockedProvider>
  );
  expect(await screen.findByText("Loading...")).toBeInTheDocument();
  expect(await screen.findByText("Buck is a poodle")).toBeInTheDocument();
});
```

## Testing error states

Your component's error states are just as important to test as its success state, if not more so. You can use the `MockedProvider` component to simulate both network errors and GraphQL errors.

* Network errors are errors that occur while your client attempts to communicate with your GraphQL server.
* GraphQL errors are errors that occur while your GraphQL server attempts to resolve your client's operation.

### Network errors

To simulate a network error, you can include an `error` field in your test's mock object, instead of the `result` field:

```jsx
it("should show error UI", async () => {
  const dogMock = {
    request: {
      query: GET_DOG_QUERY,
      variables: { name: "Buck" }
    },
    error: new Error("An error occurred")
  };
  render(
    <MockedProvider mocks={[dogMock]} addTypename={false}>
      <Dog name="Buck" />
    </MockedProvider>
  );
  expect(await screen.findByText("An error occurred")).toBeInTheDocument();
});
```

In this case, when the `Dog` component executes its query, the `MockedProvider` returns the corresponding error. This applies the error state to our `Dog` component, enabling us to verify that the error is handled gracefully.

### GraphQL errors

To simulate GraphQL errors, you define an `errors` field _inside_ a mock's `result` field. The value of this field is an array of instantiated `GraphQLError` objects:

```js
const dogMock = {
  // ...
  result: {
    errors: [new GraphQLError("Error!")],
  },
};
```

Because GraphQL supports returning partial results when an error occurs, a mock object's `result` can include both `errors` _and_ `data`.

## Testing mutations

You test components that use `useMutation` similarly to how you test components that use `useQuery`. Just like in your application code, the primary _difference_ is that you need to call the mutation's **mutate function** to actually execute the operation.

### Example

The following `DeleteButton` component executes the `DELETE_DOG_MUTATION` to delete a dog named `Buck` from our graph (don't worry, Buck will be fine üê∂):

```jsx title="delete-dog.jsx"
import React from "react";
import { gql, useMutation } from "@apollo/client";

export const DELETE_DOG_MUTATION = gql`
  mutation deleteDog($name: String!) {
    deleteDog(name: $name) {
      id
      name
      breed
    }
  }
`;

export function DeleteButton() {
  const [mutate, { loading, error, data }] = useMutation(DELETE_DOG_MUTATION);

  if (loading) return <p>Loading...</p>;
  if (error) return <p>Error!</p>;
  if (data) return <p>Deleted!</p>;

  return (
    <button onClick={() => mutate({ variables: { name: "Buck" } })}>
      Click to Delete Buck
    </button>
  );
}
```

We can test the initial rendering of this component just like we [tested our `Dog` component](#example):

```jsx title="delete-dog.test.js"
import '@testing-library/jest-dom';
import userEvent from '@testing-library/user-event';
import { render, screen } from '@testing-library/react';
import { MockedProvider } from "@apollo/client/testing";
import { DeleteButton, DELETE_DOG_MUTATION } from "./delete-dog";

it("should render without error", () => {
  render(
    <MockedProvider mocks={[]}>
      <DeleteButton />
    </MockedProvider>
  );
});
```

In the test above, `DELETE_DOG_MUTATION` is _not_ executed, because the mutate function is not called.

The following test _does_ execute the mutation by clicking the button:

```jsx title="delete-dog.test.js"
it("should render loading and success states on delete", async () => {
  const deleteDog = { name: "Buck", breed: "Poodle", id: 1 };
  const mocks = [
    {
      request: {
        query: DELETE_DOG_MUTATION,
        variables: { name: "Buck" }
      },
      result: { data: deleteDog }
    }
  ];

  render(
    <MockedProvider mocks={mocks} addTypename={false}>
      <DeleteButton />
    </MockedProvider>
  );

  // Find the button element...
  const button = await screen.findByText("Click to Delete Buck");
  userEvent.click(button); // Simulate a click and fire the mutation

  expect(await screen.findByText("Loading...")).toBeInTheDocument();
  expect(await screen.findByText("Deleted!")).toBeInTheDocument();
});
```

Again, this example is similar to [the `useQuery`-based component above](#example), but it differs after the rendering is completed. Because this component relies on a button click to fire a mutation, we use Testing Library's [user-event](https://github.com/testing-library/user-event) library to simulate a click with its `click` method. This fires off the mutation, and the rest of the test runs as expected.

Remember that the mock's value for `result` can also be a function, so you can perform arbitrary logic (like setting a boolean to indicate that the mutation completed) before returning its result.

[Testing error states](#testing-error-states) for mutations is identical to testing them for queries.

## Testing with the cache

If your application sets any [cache configuration options](../caching/cache-configuration/#configuration-options) (such as `possibleTypes` or `typePolicies`), you should provide `MockedProvider` with an instance of `InMemoryCache` that sets the exact same options:

```jsx
const cache = new InMemoryCache({
  // ...configuration options...
})

<MockedProvider mocks={mocks} cache={cache}>
  <DeleteButton />
</MockedProvider>,
```

The following sample specifies `possibleTypes` and `typePolicies` in its cache configuration, both of which must also be specified in relevant tests to prevent unexpected behavior.

<ExpansionPanel title="Click to expand üê∂">

```jsx
// "Dog" supertype can be of type "ShibaInu"
const ShibaFragment = gql`
  fragment ShibaInuFields on Dog {
    ... on ShibaInu {
      tail {
        isCurly
      }
    }
  }
`;

export const GET_DOG_QUERY = gql`
  query GetDog($name: String) {
    dog(name: $name) {
      id
      name
      breed

      ...ShibaInuFields
    }
  }

  ${ShibaFragment}
`;

export const cache = new ApolloClient({
  cache: new InMemoryCache({
    possibleTypes: {
      Dog: ["ShibaInu"],
    },
    // suppose you want you key fields for "Dog" to not be simply "id"
    typePolicies: {
      keyFields: {
        Dog: ["name", "breed"],
      },
    },
  }),
});
```

</ExpansionPanel>

## Testing local state

In order to properly test local state using `MockedProvider`, you'll need to pass a configured cache into `MockedProvider` itself.

`MockedProvider` creates its own ApolloClient instance behind the scenes like this:

```jsx
const { mocks, addTypename, defaultOptions, cache, resolvers, link } =
  this.props;
const client = new ApolloClient({
  cache: cache || new Cache({ addTypename }),
  defaultOptions,
  link: link || new MockLink(mocks || [], addTypename),
  resolvers,
});
```

Therefore if you're using Apollo Client 2.x local resolvers, or Apollo Client 3.x type/field policies, you have to tell the `MockedProvider` component what you're going to do with `@client` fields. Otherwise the `ApolloClient` instance created behind the scenes doesn't know how handle your tests.

If using Apollo Client 2.x local resolvers, make sure your resolvers object is passed into `MockedProvider`:

```jsx
<MockedProvider mocks={mocks} resolvers={resolvers} ...
```

If using Apollo Client 3.x type/field policies, make sure your configured cache instance (with your typePolicies) is passed into `MockedProvider`:

```jsx
<MockedProvider mocks={mocks} cache={cache} ...
```

If you're using Apollo Client 2.x [local resolvers](../local-state/local-resolvers/), you _also_ need to pass your resolver map:

```jsx
<MockedProvider mocks={mocks} cache={cache} resolvers={resolvers} ...
```


This is necessary because otherwise, the `MockedProvider` component doesn't know how resolve [local-only fields](../local-state/managing-state-with-field-policies/) in your queries.

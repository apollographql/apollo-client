<tr>
<td>

###### `variables`

`{ [key: string]: any }`

</td>

<td>

An object containing all of the GraphQL variables your query requires to execute.

Each key in the object corresponds to a variable name, and that key's value corresponds to the variable value.

</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>

###### `errorPolicy`

`ErrorPolicy`

</td>

<td>

Specifies how the query handles a response that returns both GraphQL errors and partial results.

For details, see [GraphQL error policies](/react/data/error-handling/#graphql-error-policies).

The default value is `none`, which causes the `useReadQuery` hook to throw the error.

</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>

###### `context`

`Record<string, any>`

</td>

<td>

If you're using [Apollo Link](/react/api/link/introduction/), this object is the initial value of the `context` object that's passed along your link chain.

</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>

###### `canonizeResults`

`Boolean`

</td>

<td>

> **⚠️ Deprecated**:
> Using `canonizeResults` can result in memory leaks so we generally do not recommend using this option anymore.
> A future version of Apollo Client will contain a similar feature without the risk of memory leaks.

If `true`, result objects read from the cache will be _canonized_, which means deeply-equal objects will also be `===` (literally the same object), allowing much more efficient comparison of past/present results.

The default value is `false`.

</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>

###### `client`

`ApolloClient`

</td>

<td>

The instance of `ApolloClient` to use to execute the query.

By default, the instance that's passed down via context is used, but you can provide a different instance here.

</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td colspan="2">

**Caching options**

</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>

###### `fetchPolicy`

`SuspenseQueryHookFetchPolicy`

</td>

<td>

Specifies how the query interacts with the Apollo Client cache during execution (for example, whether it checks the cache for results before sending a request to the server).

For details, see [Setting a fetch
policy](/react/data/queries/#setting-a-fetch-policy). This hook only supports
the `cache-first`, `network-only`, `no-cache`, and `cache-and-network` fetch
policies.

The default value is `cache-first`.

</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>

###### `returnPartialData`

`boolean`

</td>

<td>

If `true`, the query can return _partial_ results from the cache if the cache doesn't contain results for _all_ queried fields.

The default value is `false`.

</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>

###### `refetchWritePolicy`

`"merge" | "overwrite"`

</td>

<td>

Watched queries must opt into overwriting existing data on refetch, by passing `refetchWritePolicy: "overwrite"` in their `WatchQueryOptions`.

The default value is `"overwrite"`.

</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>

###### `skip` (deprecated)

`boolean`
</td>

<td>

If `true`, the query is not executed. The default value is `false`.

This option is deprecated and only supported to ease the migration from `useQuery`. It will be removed in a future release.
Please use [`skipToken`](/react/api/react/hooks#skiptoken`) instead of the `skip` option as it is more type-safe.

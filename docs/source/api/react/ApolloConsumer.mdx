## The `ApolloConsumer` component

To access the configured Apollo Client instance directly, create an `ApolloConsumer` component and provide a render prop function as its child. The render prop function is called with your `ApolloClient` instance as its only argument. The `ApolloConsumer` component is similar to the `Consumer` component from the [React Context API](https://react.dev/reference/react/useContext).

### Example

```jsx
import { ApolloConsumer } from '@apollo/client/react';

function WithApolloClient() {
  return (
    <ApolloConsumer>
      {client => 'We have access to the client!' /* do stuff here */}
    </ApolloConsumer>
  );
}
```

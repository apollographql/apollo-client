## Cache Sizes

For better performance, Apollo Client caches (or, in other words, memoizes) many
internally calculated values.
In most cases, these values are cached in [weak caches](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weak_reference), which means that if the
source object is garbage-collected, the cached value will be garbage-collected,
too.

These caches are also Least Recently Used (LRU) caches, meaning that if the cache is full,
the least recently used value will be garbage-collected.

Depending on your application, you might want to tweak the cache size to fit your
needs.

You can set your cache size [before (recommended)](#setting-cache-sizes-before-loading-the-apollo-client-library) or [after](#adjusting-cache-sizes-after-loading-the-apollo-client-library) loading the Apollo Client library.

### Setting cache sizes before loading the Apollo Client library

Setting cache sizes before loading the Apollo Client library is recommended because some caches are already initialized when the library is loaded. Changed cache sizes only
affect caches created after the fact, so you'd have to write additional runtime code to recreate these caches after changing their size.

 ```ts
import type { CacheSizes } from '@apollo/client/utilities';

 globalThis[Symbol.for("apollo.cacheSize")] = {
  parser: 100,
  "fragmentRegistry.lookup": 500
 } satisfies Partial<CacheSizes>
 ```

### Adjusting cache sizes after loading the Apollo Client library

You can also adjust cache sizes after loading the library.

```js
import { cacheSizes } from '@apollo/client/utilities';
import { print } from '@apollo/client'

cacheSizes.print = 100;
// cache sizes changed this way will only take effect for caches 
// created after the cache size has been changed, so we need to 
// reset the cache for it to be effective

print.reset();
```

### Choosing appropriate cache sizes

<Remarks
  canonicalReference="@apollo/client!CacheSizes:interface"
/>

To choose good sizes for our memoization caches, you need to know what they
use as source values, and have a general understanding of the data flow inside of
Apollo Client.

For most memoized values, the source value is a parsed GraphQL document&mdash;
a `DocumentNode`. There are two types:

* **User-supplied `DocumentNode`s** are created
  by the user, for example by using the `gql` template literal tag.
  This is the `QUERY`, `MUTATION`, or `SUBSCRIPTION` argument passed
  into a [`useQuery` hook](../data/queries/#usequery-api) or as the `query` option to `client.query`.
* **Transformed `DocumentNode`s** are derived from
  user-supplied `DocumentNode`s, for example, by applying [`DocumentTransform`s](../data/document-transforms/) to them.

As a rule of thumb, you should set the cache sizes for caches using a transformed
`DocumentNode` at least to the same size as for caches using a user-supplied
`DocumentNode`. If your application uses a custom `DocumentTransform` that does
not always transform the same input to the same output, you should set the cache
size for caches using a Transformed `DocumentNode` to a higher value than for
caches using a user-supplied `DocumentNode`.

By default, Apollo Client uses a base value of 1000 cached objects for caches using
user-supplied `DocumentNode` instances, and scales other cache sizes relative
to that. For example, the default base value of 1000 for user-provided `DocumentNode`s would scale to 2000, 4000, etc. for transformed `DocumentNode`s, depending on the transformation performed.

This base value should be plenty for most applications, but you can tweak them if you have different requirements.

#### Measuring cache usage

Since estimating appropriate cache sizes for your application can be hard, Apollo Client
exposes an API for cache usage measurement.<br />
This way, you can click around in your application and then take a look at the
actual usage of the memoizing caches.

Keep in mind that this API is primarily meant for usage with the Apollo DevTools
(an integration is coming soon), and the API may change at any
point in time.<br />
It is also only included in development builds, not in production builds.

<Note>

The cache usage API is only meant for manual measurements. Don't rely on it in production code or tests.

title: "Using the @defer directive in Apollo Client"
description: Receive query response data incrementally
---

> ⚠️ **The `@defer` directive is currently at the [preview stage](/resources/product-launch-stages/#preview) in Apollo Client, and is available by installing `@apollo/client@latest`.** If you have feedback on it, please let us know via [GitHub issues](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-client/issues/new?assignees=&labels=&template=bug.md).

Beginning with version `3.7.0`, Apollo Client Web provides preview support for [the `@defer` directive](https://github.com/graphql/graphql-wg/blob/main/rfcs/DeferStream.md). This directive enables your queries to receive data for specific fields _incrementally_, instead of receiving all field data at the same time. This is helpful whenever some fields in a query take much longer to resolve than others.

> For a query to defer fields successfully, the queried endpoint must _also_ support the `@defer` directive.

## Example

Let's say we're building a social media application that can quickly fetch a user's basic profile information, but retrieving that user's friends takes longer. If we include _all_ of those fields in a single query, we want to be able to display the profile information as soon as it's available, instead of waiting for the friend fields to resolve.

To achieve this, we apply the `@defer` directive to an in-line fragment that contains all slow-resolving fields related to friend data:

```graphql
query PersonQuery($personId: ID!) {
  person(id: $personId) {
    # Basic fields (fast)
    id
    firstName
    lastName

    # highlight-start
    # Friend fields (slower)
    ... @defer {
      friends {
        id
      }
    }
    # highlight-end
  }
}
```

Using this syntax, _if the queried server supports `@defer`,_ our client can receive the "Basic fields" in an initial response payload, followed by a supplementary payload containing the "Friend fields".

## Using with code generation

If you currently use [GraphQL Code Generator](https://www.the-guild.dev/graphql/codegen) for your codegen needs, note that it doesn't yet support the use of the `@defer` directive in the code output.

The status of this support is tracked in [this GitHub issue](https://github.com/dotansimha/graphql-code-generator/issues/7885).

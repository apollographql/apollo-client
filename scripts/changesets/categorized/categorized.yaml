    Rework package publish format (#12329, #12382)


    We have reworked the way Apollo Client is packaged.


    * shipping ESM and CJS

    * fixing up source maps

    * the build targets a modern runtime environment (browserslist query:
    `"since 2023, node >= 20, not dead"`)

    * removed the "proxy directory" `package.json` files, e.g.
    `cache/core/package.json` and `react/package.json`. While these helped with
    older build tools, modern build tooling uses the `exports` field in the root
    `package.json` instead and the presence of these files can confuse modern
    build tooling. If your build tooling still relies on those, please update
    your imports to import from e.g. `@apollo/client/cache/core/index.js`
    instead of `@apollo/client/cache/core` - but generally, this should not be
    necessary.

    * added an `exports` field to `package.json` to expose entry points

    * instead of `globalThis.__DEV__`, Apollo Client now primarily relies on the
    `development` and `production` exports conditions. It falls back to
    `globalThis.__DEV__` if the bundler doesn't know these, though.
  real-gorillas-move: >-
    Apollo Client now defaults to production mode, not development mode, if the

    environment cannot be determined.


    In modern bundlers, this should automatically be handled by the bundler
    loading

    the bundler with the `development` export condition.


    If neither the `production` nor the `development` export condition are

    used by the bundler/runtime, Apollo Client will fall back to
    `globalThis.__DEV__`

    to determine if it should run in production or development mode.


    Unlike Apollo Client 3 though, if `globalThis.__DEV__` is not set to `true`,

    Apollo Client will now default to `production`, not to `development`,
    behaviour.


    This switch to *explicilty* requiring `true` also resolves a situation where

    an HTML element with `id="__DEV__"` would create a global `__DEV__` variable

    with a referent to the DOM element, which in the past was picked up as
    "truthy" and

    would have triggered development mode.

errors:
  good-dolphins-peel: >-
    Apollo Client no longer wraps errors in `ApolloError`. `ApolloError` has
    been replaced with separate error classes depending on the cause of the
    error. As such, APIs that return an `error` property have been updated to
    use the generic `Error` type. Use `instanceof` to check for more specific
    error types.


    ## Migration guide


    `ApolloError` encapsulated 4 main error properties. The type of error would
    determine which property was set:

    - `graphqlErrors` - Errors returned from the `errors` field by the GraphQL
    server

    - `networkError` - Any non-GraphQL error that caused the query to fail

    - `protocolErrors` - Transport-level errors that occur during [multipart
    HTTP
    subscriptions](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/graphos/routing/operations/subscriptions/multipart-protocol)

    - `clientErrors` - A space to define custom errors. Mostly unused.


    These errors were mutally exclusive, meaning both `networkError` and
    `graphqlErrors` were never set simultaneously. The following replaces each
    of these fields from `ApolloError`.


    ### `graphqlErrors`


    GraphQL errors are now encapsulated in a `CombinedGraphQLErrors` instance.
    You can access the raw GraphQL errors via the `errors` property.


    ```js

    import { CombinedGraphQLErrors } from '@apollo/client';


    // ...


    const { error } = useQuery(query);


    if (error && error instanceof CombinedGraphQLErrors) {
      console.log(error.errors);
    }

    ```


    ### `networkError`


    Network errors are no longer wrapped and are instead passed through
    directly.


    ```js

    const client = new ApolloClient({
      link: new ApolloLink(() => {
        return new Observable((observer) => {
          observer.error(new Error('Test error'));
        })
      })
    })


    // ...


    const { error } = useQuery(query);


    // error is `new Error('Test error')`;

    ```


    ### `protocolErrors`


    Protocol errors are now encapsulated in a `CombinedProtocolErrors` instance.
    You can access the raw protocol errors via the `errors` property.



    ```js

    import { CombinedProtocolErrors } from '@apollo/client';


    // ...


    const { error } = useSubscription(subscription);


    if (error && error instanceof CombinedProtocolErrors) {
      console.log(error.errors);
    }

    ```


    ### `clientErrors`


    These were unused by the client and have no replacement. Any non-GraphQL or
    non-protocol errors are now passed through unwrapped.


    ### Strings as errors


    If the link sends a string error, Apollo Client will wrap this in an `Error`
    instance. This ensures `error` properties are guaranteed to be of type
    `Error`.


    ```js

    const client = new ApolloClient({
      link: new ApolloLink(() => {
        return new Observable((observer) => {
          // Oops we sent a string instead of wrapping it in an `Error`
          observer.error('Test error');
        })
      })
    })


    // ...


    const { error } = useQuery(query);


    // The error string is wrapped and returned as `new Error('Test error')`;

    ```


    ### Non-error types


    If the link chain sends any other object type as an error, Apollo Client
    will wrap this in an `UnknownError` instance with the
    [`cause`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Error/cause)
    set to the original object. This ensures `error` properties are guaranteed
    to be of type `Error`.


    ```js

    const client = new ApolloClient({
      link: new ApolloLink(() => {
        return new Observable((observer) => {
          observer.error({ message: 'Not a proper error type' });
        })
      })
    })


    // ...


    const { error } = useQuery(query);


    // error is an `UnknownError` instance. error.cause returns the original
    object.

    ```
  curvy-shoes-refuse: >-
    More strictly adhere to the [GraphQL over HTTP
    spec](https://graphql.github.io/graphql-over-http/draft/). This change adds
    support for the `application/graphql-response+json` media type and modifies
    the behavior of the `application/json` media type.


    - The client will parse the response as a well-formed GraphQL response when
    the server encodes `content-type` using `application/graphql-response+json`
    with a non-200 status code.

    - The client will now throw a `ServerError` when the server encodes
    `content-type` using `application/json` and returns a non-200 status code.

    - The client will now throw a `ServerError` when the server encodes using
    any other `content-type` and returns a non-200 status code.


    NOTE: If you use a testing utility to mock requests in your test, you may
    experience different behavior than production if your testing utility
    responds as `application/json` but your production server responds as
    `application/graphql-response+json`. If a `content-type` header is not set,
    the client interprets the response as `application/json`.
  four-ghosts-watch: >-
    Network errors triggered by queries now adhere to the `errorPolicy`. This
    means that GraphQL errors and network errors now behave the same way.
    Previously promise-based APIs, such as `client.query`, would reject the
    promise with the network error even if `errorPolicy` was set to `ignore`.
    The promise is now resolved with the `error` property set to the network
    error instead.
  four-countries-clean: >-
    Add a static `is` method to error types defined by Apollo Client. `is` makes
    it simpler to determine whether an error is a specific type, which can be
    helpful in cases where you'd like to narrow the error type in order to use
    specific properties from that error.


    This change applies to the following error types:

    - `CombinedGraphQLErrors`

    - `CombinedProtocolErrors`

    - `ServerError`

    - `ServerParseError`

    - `UnconventionalError`


    **Example**


    ```ts

    import { CombinedGraphQLErrors } from "@apollo/client";


    if (CombinedGraphQLErrors.is(error)) {
      console.log(error.message);
      error.errors.forEach((graphQLError) => console.log(graphQLError.message))
    }

    ```
  bright-ads-share: >-

    To detect if an error was emitted from the link chain, use `LinkError.is`.


    ```ts

    import { LinkError } from "@apollo/client";


    client.query({ query }).catch((error) => {

    `ObservableQuery`s will now only be registered with the `ApolloClient` while

    That means that `ApolloClient.getObservableQueries` and
    `ApolloClient.refetchQueries`

    will only be able to return/refetch queries that have at least one
    subscriber.


    This changes the previous meaning of `active` and `inactive` queries:

    * `inactive` queries are queries with a subscriber that are skipped from a
      React hook or have a `fetchPolicy` of `standby`
    * `active` queries are queries with at least one subscriber that are not
    skipped or in `standby`.


    `ObservableQuery`s without subscribers but with an active ongoing network
    request

    (e.g. caused by calling `reobserve`) will be handled as if they had a
    subscriber

    for the duration of the query.

  cuddly-spiders-tie: >-
    Remove `TSerialized` generic argument to `ApolloCache`. The `ApolloCache`
    base cache abstraction now returns `unknown` for `cache.extract` which can
    be overridden by a cache subclass.
  curvy-lamps-sing: >-
    Provide a mechanism to override the DataMasking types.


    Up until now, our types `Masked`, `MaskedDocumentNode`, `FragmentType`,
    `MaybeMasked` and `Unmasked` would assume that you are stictly using the
    type output format of GraphQL Codegen.


    With this change, you can now modify the behaviour of those types if you use
    a different form of codegen that produces different types for your queries.


    A simple implementation that would override the `Masked` type to remove all
    fields starting with `_` from a type would look like this:


    ```ts

    // your actual implementation of `Masked`

    type CustomMaskedImplementation<TData> = {
      [K in keyof TData as K extends `_${string}` ? never : K]: TData[K];
    };


    import { HKT } from "@apollo/client/utilities";

    // transform this type into a higher kinded type that can be evaulated at a
    later time

    interface CustomMaskedType extends HKT {
      arg1: unknown; // TData
      return: CustomMaskedImplementation<this["arg1"]>;
    }


    // create an "implementation interface" for the types you want to override

    export interface CustomDataMaskingImplementation {
      Masked: CustomMaskedType;
      // other possible keys: `MaskedDocumentNode`, `FragmentType`, `MaybeMasked` and `Unmasked`
    }

    ```

    then you would use that `CustomDataMaskingImplementation` interface in your
    project to extend the `TypeOverrides` interface exported by `@apollo/client`
    with it's functionality:


    ```ts

    declare module "@apollo/client" {
      export interface TypeOverrides extends CustomDataMaskingImplementation {}
    }

    ```


    After that, all internal usage of `Masked` in Apollo Client as well as all
    usage in your code base will use the new `CustomMaskedType` implementation.


    If you don't specify overrides, Apollo Client will still default to the
    GraphQL Codegen data masking implementation.

    The types for that are also explicitly exported as the
    `GraphQLCodegenDataMasking` namespace in `@apollo/client/masking`.

    The `TData` generic provided to types that return a `dataState` property is
    now modified by the given `DataState` generic instead of passing a modified
    `TData` type. For example, a `QueryRef` that could return partial data was
    defined as `QueryRef<DeepPartial<TData>, TVariables>`. Now `TData` should be
    provided unmodified and a set of allowed states should be given instead:
    `QueryRef<TData, TVariables, 'complete' | 'streaming' | 'partial'>`.


    To migrate, use the following guide to replace your type with the right set
    of states (all types listed below are changed the same way):


    ```diff

    - QueryRef<TData, TVariables>

    // `QueryRef`'s default is 'complete' | 'streaming' so this can also be left
    alone if you prefer

    // All other types affected by this change default to all states

    + QueryRef<TData, TVariables>

    + QueryRef<TData, TVariables, 'complete' | 'streaming'>


    - QueryRef<TData | undefined, TVariables>

    + QueryRef<TData, TVariables, 'complete' | 'streaming' | 'empty'>


    - QueryRef<DeepPartial<TData>, TVariables>

    + QueryRef<TData, TVariables, 'complete' | 'streaming' | 'partial'>


    - QueryRef<DeepPartial<TData> | undefined, TVariables>

    + QueryRef<TData, TVariables, 'complete' | 'streaming' | 'partial' |
    'empty'>

    ```


    The following types are affected. Provide the allowed `dataState` values to
    the `TDataState` generic:

    - `ApolloQueryResult`

    - `QueryRef`

    - `PreloadedQueryRef`

    - `useLazyQuery.Result`

    - `useQuery.Result`

    - `useReadQuery.Result`

    - `useSuspenseQuery.Result`


    All `*QueryRef` types default to `complete | streaming` states while the
    rest of the types default to `'complete' | 'streaming' | 'partial' |
    'empty'` states. You shouldn't need to provide the states unless you need to
    either allow for partial data/empty values (`*QueryRef`) or a restricted set
    of states.

    Provide an extension to define types for `context` passed to the link chain.
    To define your own types, use [declaration
    merging](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/declaration-merging.html)
    to add properties to the `DefaultContext` type.


    ```ts

    // @apollo-client.d.ts

    // This import is necessary to ensure all Apollo Client imports

    // are still available to the rest of the application.

    declare module "@apollo/client" {
      interface DefaultContext extends Record<string, any> {
        myProperty: string;
      }
    }

    ```


    Links that provide context options can be used with this type to add those
    context types to `DefaultContext`. For example, to add context options from
    `HttpLink`, add the following code:


    ```ts

    import { HttpLink } from "@apollo/client";


    declare module "@apollo/client" {
      interface DefaultContext extends HttpLink.ContextOptions {
        myProperty: string;
      }

    * `FetchResult` is now used to refer to an unhandled "raw" result as
    returned from
      a link.
      This can also include incremental results that use a different format.
    * `FormattedExecutionResult` from the `graphql` package is now used to
    represent
      the execution of a standard GraphQL request without incremental results.

    If your custom links access the `data` property, you might need to first
    check if

    the result is a standard GraphQL result by using the
    `isFormattedExecutionResult`

    helper from `@apollo/client/utilities`.
  tidy-pandas-punch: >-
    `ObservableQuery.variables` has been updated to return `TVariables` rather
    than `TVariables | undefined`. This is more consistent with the runtime
    value where an empty object (`{}`) will be returned when the `variables`
    option is not provided.
  young-phones-fold: >-
    Default the `TData` generic type to `unknown` in all APIs that use a `TData`
    generic argument such as `useQuery`, `client.query`, etc.
  rude-crabs-eat: >-
    The `operation` argument to the callback passed to `SetContextLink` is now
    of type `SetContextLink.SetContextOperation` which is an `Operation` without
    the `getContext` or `setContext` functions. Previously the type of
    `operation` was `GraphQLRequest` which had access to a `context` property.
    The `context` property was always `undefined` and could result in bugs when
    using it instead of the `prevContext` argument.


    This change means the `operation` argument now contains an accessible
    `client` property.
dataState:
  healthy-books-flash: >-
    The `TData` generic provided to types that return a `dataState` property is
    now modified by the given `DataState` generic instead of passing a modified
    `TData` type. For example, a `QueryRef` that could return partial data was
    defined as `QueryRef<DeepPartial<TData>, TVariables>`. Now `TData` should be
    provided unmodified and a set of allowed states should be given instead:
    `QueryRef<TData, TVariables, 'complete' | 'streaming' | 'partial'>`.


    To migrate, use the following guide to replace your type with the right set
    of states (all types listed below are changed the same way):


    ```diff

    - QueryRef<TData, TVariables>

    // `QueryRef`'s default is 'complete' | 'streaming' so this can also be left
    alone if you prefer

    // All other types affected by this change default to all states

    + QueryRef<TData, TVariables>

    + QueryRef<TData, TVariables, 'complete' | 'streaming'>


    - QueryRef<TData | undefined, TVariables>

    + QueryRef<TData, TVariables, 'complete' | 'streaming' | 'empty'>


    - QueryRef<DeepPartial<TData>, TVariables>

    + QueryRef<TData, TVariables, 'complete' | 'streaming' | 'partial'>


    - QueryRef<DeepPartial<TData> | undefined, TVariables>

    + QueryRef<TData, TVariables, 'complete' | 'streaming' | 'partial' |
    'empty'>

    ```


    The following types are affected. Provide the allowed `dataState` values to
    the `TDataState` generic:

    - `ApolloQueryResult`

    - `QueryRef`

    - `PreloadedQueryRef`

    - `useLazyQuery.Result`

    - `useQuery.Result`

    - `useReadQuery.Result`

    - `useSuspenseQuery.Result`


    All `*QueryRef` types default to `complete | streaming` states while the
    rest of the types default to `'complete' | 'streaming' | 'partial' |
    'empty'` states. You shouldn't need to provide the states unless you need to
    either allow for partial data/empty values (`*QueryRef`) or a restricted set
    of states.

    The callback function that can be passed to the `ApolloClient.mutate`

    `refetchQueries` option will now receive a `FormattedExecutionResult` with
    an

    additional `dataState` option that describes if the result is `"streaming"`

    or `"complete"`.

    This indicates whether the `data` value is of type

    * `Unmasked<TData>` (if `"complete"`)

    * `Streaming<Unmasked<TData>>` (if `"streaming"`)
  plenty-deers-clean: >-
    Added a new `Streaming` type that will mark `data` in results while
    `dataState`

    is `"streaming"`.


    `Streaming<TData>` defaults to `TData`, but can be overwritten in userland
    to

    integrate with different codegen dialects.


    You can override this type globally - this example shows how to override it

    with `DeepPartial<TData>`:

    ```ts

    import { HKT, DeepPartial } from "@apollo/client/utilities";


    type StreamingOverride<TData> = DeepPartial<TData>;


    interface StreamingOverrideHKT extends HKT {
      return: StreamingOverride<this["arg1"]>;
    }


    declare module "@apollo/client" {
      export interface TypeOverrides {
        Streaming: StreamingOverrideHKT;
      }
    }

    ```
  proud-walls-shave: >-
    Overridable types for `dataState: "complete"`, `dataState: "streaming"` and

    `dataState: "partial"` responses.


    This adds the `DataValue` namespace exported from Apollo Client with the
    three

    types `DataValue.Complete`, `DataValue.Streaming` and `DataValue.Partial`.


    These types will be used to mark `TData` in the respective states.


    * `Complete` defaults to `TData`

    * `Streaming` defaults to `TData`

    * `Partial` defaults to `DeepPartial<TData>`


    All three can be overwritten, e.g. to be `DeepReadonly` using higher kinded
    types

    by following this pattern:


    ```ts

    import { HKT, DeepPartial } from "@apollo/client/utilities";

    import { DeepReadonly } from "some-type-helper-library";


    interface CompleteOverride extends HKT {
      return: DeepReadonly<this["arg1"]>;
    }


    interface StreamingOverride extends HKT {
      return: DeepReadonly<this["arg1"]>;
    }


    interface PartialOverride extends HKT {
      return: DeepReadonly<DeepPartial<this["arg1"]>>;
    }


    declare module "@apollo/client" {
      export interface TypeOverrides {
        Complete: CompleteOverride;
        Streaming: StreamingOverride;
        Partial: PartialOverride;

    }

    ```

  wild-carpets-exercise: >-
    Add a new `dataState` property that determines the completeness of the
    `data` property. `dataState` helps narrow the type of `data`. `dataState` is
    now emitted from `ObservableQuery` and returned from all React hooks that
    return a `data` property.


    The `dataState` values are:


    - `empty`: No data could be fulfilled from the cache or the result is
    incomplete. `data` is `undefined`.

    - `partial`: Some data could be fulfilled from the cache but `data` is
    incomplete. This is only possible when `returnPartialData` is `true`.

    - `streaming`: `data` is incomplete as a result of a deferred query and the
    result is still streaming in.

    - `complete`: `data` is a fully satisfied query result fulfilled either from
    the cache or network.


    Example:


    ```ts

    const { data, dataState } = useQuery<TData>(query);


    if (dataState === 'empty') {
      expectTypeOf(data).toEqualTypeOf<undefined>();
    }


    if (dataState === 'partial') {
      expectTypeOf(data).toEqualTypeOf<DeepPartial<TData>>();
    }


    if (dataState === 'streaming') {
      expectTypeOf(data).toEqualTypeOf<TData>();
    }


    if (dataState === 'complete') {
      expectTypeOf(data).toEqualTypeOf<TData>();
    }

data_masking:
  curvy-lamps-sing: >-
    Provide a mechanism to override the DataMasking types.


    Up until now, our types `Masked`, `MaskedDocumentNode`, `FragmentType`,
    `MaybeMasked` and `Unmasked` would assume that you are stictly using the
    type output format of GraphQL Codegen.


    With this change, you can now modify the behaviour of those types if you use
    a different form of codegen that produces different types for your queries.


    A simple implementation that would override the `Masked` type to remove all
    fields starting with `_` from a type would look like this:


    ```ts

    // your actual implementation of `Masked`

    type CustomMaskedImplementation<TData> = {
      [K in keyof TData as K extends `_${string}` ? never : K]: TData[K];
    };


    import { HKT } from "@apollo/client/utilities";

    // transform this type into a higher kinded type that can be evaulated at a
    later time

    interface CustomMaskedType extends HKT {
      arg1: unknown; // TData
      return: CustomMaskedImplementation<this["arg1"]>;
    }


    // create an "implementation interface" for the types you want to override

    export interface CustomDataMaskingImplementation {
      Masked: CustomMaskedType;
      // other possible keys: `MaskedDocumentNode`, `FragmentType`, `MaybeMasked` and `Unmasked`
    }

    ```

    then you would use that `CustomDataMaskingImplementation` interface in your
    project to extend the `TypeOverrides` interface exported by `@apollo/client`
    with it's functionality:


    ```ts

    declare module "@apollo/client" {
      export interface TypeOverrides extends CustomDataMaskingImplementation {}
    }

    ```


    After that, all internal usage of `Masked` in Apollo Client as well as all
    usage in your code base will use the new `CustomMaskedType` implementation.


    If you don't specify overrides, Apollo Client will still default to the
    GraphQL Codegen data masking implementation.

    The types for that are also explicitly exported as the
    `GraphQLCodegenDataMasking` namespace in `@apollo/client/masking`.
subscriptions:
  rare-apes-drive: >-
    Deduplicating subscription operations is now supported. Previously it was
    possible to deduplicate a subscription only if the new subscription was
    created before a previously subscribed subscription emitted any values. As
    soon as a value was emitted from a subscription, new subscriptions would
    create new connections. Deduplication is now active for as long as a
    subscription connection is open (i.e. the source observable hasn't emitted a
    `complete` or `error` notification yet.)


    To disable deduplication and force a new connection, use the
    `queryDeduplication` option in `context` like you would a query operation.


    As a result of this change, calling the `restart` function returned from
    `useSubscription` will now restart the connection on deduplicated
    subscriptions.
LocalState:
  flat-readers-invite: >-
    Introduce a new GraphQL Codegen plugin aimed at creating resolver types for
    `LocalState`. This plugin is similar to
    `@graphql-codegen/typescript-resolvers` but tailored to provide types that
    work with `LocalState`.


    To use the plugin, install `@apollo/client-graphql-codegen` and add the
    following to your codegen config:


    ```ts

    // codegen.ts


    const config: CodegenConfig = {
      // ...
      generates: {
        "./path/to/local/resolvers.ts": {
          schema: [
            "./path/to/localSchema.graphql",
          ],
          plugins: [
            "typescript",
            "@apollo/client-graphql-codegen/local-state",
          ],
          // ...
        }
      }
    }

    ```


    This will generate a `Resolvers` type in the generated file that can be used
    to provide type information to `LocalState`.


    ```ts

    import type { Resolvers } from "./path/to/resolvers-types.ts";


    const localState = new LocalState<Resolvers>({
      // ...
    });

    ```


    It is also recommended to add the following config:

    ```ts

    // codegen.ts

    import type { LocalStatePluginConfig } from
    "@apollo/client-graphql-codegen/local-state";


    const config: CodegenConfig = {
      // ...
      generates: {
        "./path/to/local/resolvers.ts": {
          config: {
            // Ensures you return a `__typename` for any `@client` fields that
            // return object or array types
            nonOptionalTypename: true,

            // Required if your localSchema extends existing schema types.
            baseTypesPath: "./relative/path/to/base/schema/types",

            // If you provide a `context` function to customize the context value,
            // provide the path or type here.
            contextType: "./path/to/contextValue#ContextValue",
          } satisfies LocalStatePluginConfig
        }
      }
    }

    ```


    NOTE: It is recommended that the schema file passed to the `schema` option
    is your local schema, not your entire app schema in order to only generate
    resolver types for your local fields, otherwise the plugin will generate
    resolver types for your entire remote schema as well.
  funny-boats-wink: >-
    Revamp local resolvers and fix several issues from the existing `resolvers`
    option.

    - Throwing errors in a resolver will set the field value as `null` and add
    an error to the response's `errors` array.

    - Remote results are dealiased before they are passed as the parent object
    to a resolver so that you can access fields by their field name.

    - You can now specify a `context` function that you can use to customize the
    `requestContext` given to resolvers.

    - The `LocalState` class accepts a `Resolvers` generic that provides
    autocompletion and type checking against your resolver types to ensure your
    resolvers are type-safe.

    - `data: null` is now handled correctly and does not call your local
    resolvers when the server does not provide a result.

    - Additional warnings have been added to provide hints when resolvers behave
    unexpectedly.


    ```ts

    import { LocalState } from "@apollo/client/local-state";


    import { Resolvers } from "./path/to/local-resolvers-types.ts";


    // LocalState now accepts a `Resolvers` generic.

    const localState = new LocalState<Resolvers>({
      // The return value of this funciton
      context: (options) => ({
        // ...
      }),
      resolvers: {
        // ...
      }
    });


    // You may also pass a `ContextValue` generic used to ensure the `context`

    // function returns the correct type. This type is inferred from your
    resolvers

    // if not provided.

    new LocalState<Resolvers, ContextValue>({
      // ...
    });

    ```
  kind-taxis-thank: >-
    Don't warn about a missing resolver if a `@client` does not have a
    configured resolver. It is possible the cache contains a `read` function for
    the field and the warning added confusion.


    Note that `read` functions without a defined resolver will receive the
    `existing` argument as `null` instead of `undefined` even when data hasn't
    been written to the cache. This is because `LocalState` sets a default value
    of `null` when a resolver is not defined to ensure that the field contains a
    value in case a `read` function is not defined rather than omitting the
    field entirely.

  strong-rivers-fry: >-
    The resolver function's `context` argument (the 3rd argument) has changed to
    provide additional information without the possibility of name clashes.
    Previously the `context` argument would spread request context and override
    the `client` and `cache` properties to give access to both inside of a
    resolver. The `context` argument takes now takes the following shape:


    ```ts

    {
      // the request context. By default `TContextValue` is of type `DefaultContext`,
      // but can be changed if a `context` function is provided.
      requestContext: TContextValue,
      // The client instance making the request
      client: ApolloClient,
      // Whether the resolver is run as a result of gathering exported variables
      // or resolving the value as part of the result
      phase: "exports" | "resolve"
    }

    ```


    To migrate, pull any request context from `requestContext` and the `cache`
    from the `client` property:


    ```diff

    ### Changes for users of `InMemoryCache`


    `cache.diff` no longer throws when `returnPartialData` is set to `false`
    without a complete result. Instead, `cache.diff` will return `null` when it
    is unable to read a full cache result.


    If you use `cache.diff` directly with `returnPartialData: false`, remove the
    `try`/`catch` block and replace with a check for `null`.


    ### Changes for third-party cache implementations


    The client now expects `cache.diff` to return `null` instead of throwing
    when the cache returns an incomplete result and `returnPartialData` is

    ### Changes for users of `InMemoryCache`


    `cache.diff` now returns `null` instead of an empty object (`{}`) when
    `returnPartialData` is `true` and the result is empty.


    If you use `cache.diff` directly with `returnPartialData: true`, you will
    need to check for `null` before accessing any other fields on the `result`
    property. A non-null value indicates that at least one field was present in
    the cache for the given query document.


    ### Changes for third-party cache implementations


    The client now expects `cache.diff` to return `null` instead of an empty
    object when there is no data that can be fulfilled from the cache and
    `returnPartialData` is `true`. If your cache implementation returns an empty
    object, please update this to return `null`.

    `cache.diff` no longer throws when `returnPartialData` is set to `false`
    without a complete result. Instead, `cache.diff` will return `null` when it
    is unable to read a full cache result.


    If you use `cache.diff` directly with `returnPartialData: false`, remove the
    `try`/`catch` block and replace with a check for `null`.

    Remove workarounds for streaming with non-WhatWG response bodies to reduce
    bundle size.


    This removes support for `fetch` implementations that return Node Streams,
    Async Iterators or Blob instances as `Response.body`.


    In the WhatWG Fetch specification,
    [`Response.body`](https://fetch.spec.whatwg.org/#body) is specified as a
    WhatWG [ReadableStream](https://streams.spec.whatwg.org/#readablestream).


    At this point in time, this is natively supported in browsers, `node` and
    React Native (via
    [react-native-fetch-api](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-native-fetch-api),
    see our [setup instructions for React
    Native](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/react/integrations/react-native#consuming-multipart-http-via-text-streaming)).


    If you are using an older `fetch` polyfill that deviates from the spec, this
    might not be compatible - for example,
    [node-fetch](https://github.com/node-fetch/node-fetch?tab=readme-ov-file#interface-body)
    returns a node `Readable` instead of a `ReadableStream`.

    In those cases, please switch to a compatible alternative such as the
    `node`-native `fetch`, or `undici`.

    Adds enhanced client awareness to the client.


    `HttpLink` and `BatchHttpLink` will now per default send information about
    the

    client library you are using in `extensions`.


    This could look like this:


    ```json

    {
      "query": "query GetUser($id: ID!) { user(id: $id) { __typename id name } }",
      "variables": {
        "id": 5

          "name": "@apollo/client",
          "version": "4.0.0"
        }
      }
    }

    ```


    This feature can be disabled by passing `enhancedClientAwareness: {
    transport: false }` to your

    `ApolloClient`,  `HttpLink` or `BatchHttpLink` constructor options.
  pink-ladybugs-cough: >-
    Subscriptions created by `client.subscribe()` can now be restarted.
    Restarting a subscription will terminate the connection with the link chain
    and recreate the request. Restarts also work across deduplicated
    subscriptions so calling `restart` on an `observable` who's request is
    deduplicated will restart the connection for each observable.


    ```ts

    const observable = client.subscribe({ query: subscription });


    // Restart the connection to the link

    observable.restart();

    ```
  rude-parrots-suffer: >-
    Add the new `ClientAwarenessLink`.


    This link is already included in `HttpLink` and `BatchHttpLink` to enable
    the

    "client awareness" and "enhanced client awareness" features, but you can
    also use

    `ClientAwarenessLink` directly in your link chain to combine it with other

    terminating links.


    If you want to save the bundle size that `ClientAwarenessLink` adds to
    `HttpLink`

    and `BatchHttpLink`, you can use `BaseHttpLink` or `BaseBatchHttpLink`
    instead.

    These links come without the `ClientAwarenessLink` included.


    For example:

    ```diff

    import {
      ApolloClient,
    -  HttpLink,

    } from "@apollo/client";

    +import { BaseHttpLink } from "@apollo/client/link/http";


    const client = new ApolloClient({

    -  link: new HttpLink({

    +  link: new BaseHttpLink({
        uri,
      }),
      cache: new InMemoryCache(),
    });

    ```
  rare-apes-drive: >-
    Deduplicating subscription operations is now supported. Previously it was
    possible to deduplicate a subscription only if the new subscription was
    created before a previously subscribed subscription emitted any values. As
    soon as a value was emitted from a subscription, new subscriptions would
    create new connections. Deduplication is now active for as long as a
    subscription connection is open (i.e. the source observable hasn't emitted a
    `complete` or `error` notification yet.)


    To disable deduplication and force a new connection, use the
    `queryDeduplication` option in `context` like you would a query operation.


    As a result of this change, calling the `restart` function returned from
    `useSubscription` will now restart the connection on deduplicated
    subscriptions.

    Replace the `result` property on `ServerError` with `bodyText`. `bodyText`

  curvy-shoes-refuse: >-
    More strictly adhere to the [GraphQL over HTTP
    spec](https://graphql.github.io/graphql-over-http/draft/). This change adds
    support for the `application/graphql-response+json` media type and modifies
    the behavior of the `application/json` media type.


    - The client will parse the response as a well-formed GraphQL response when
    the server encodes `content-type` using `application/graphql-response+json`
    with a non-200 status code.

    - The client will now throw a `ServerError` when the server encodes
    `content-type` using `application/json` and returns a non-200 status code.

    - The client will now throw a `ServerError` when the server encodes using
    any other `content-type` and returns a non-200 status code.


    NOTE: If you use a testing utility to mock requests in your test, you may
    experience different behavior than production if your testing utility
    responds as `application/json` but your production server responds as
    `application/graphql-response+json`. If a `content-type` header is not set,
    the client interprets the response as `application/json`.

    The incremental delivery (`@defer` support) implementation is now pluggable.


    `ApolloClient` now per default ships without an incremental format
    implementation

    and allows you to swap in the format that you want to use.


    Usage looks like this:


    ```ts

    import {
      // this is the default
      NotImplementedHandler,
      // this implements the `@defer` transport format that ships with Apollo Router
      Defer20220824Handler,
      // this implements the `@defer` transport format that ships with GraphQL 17.0.0-alpha.2
      GraphQL17Alpha2Handler,
    } from "@apollo/client/incremental";


    const client = new ApolloClient({
      cache: new InMemoryCache({ /*...*/ }),
      link: new HttpLink({ /*...*/ }),
      incrementalHandler: new Defer20220824Handler(),
    });

    ```


    We will add handlers for other response formats that can be swapped this way

    during the lifetime of Apollo Client 4.0.

    This priority has been adjusted so now both `skip` and `fetchPolicy:

    when calling `refetch`, `fetchMore`, etc. To maintain the old behavior, set
    `notifyOnNetworkStatusChange` to `false` in `defaultOptions`.


    ```ts

    new ApolloClient({

  twelve-mangos-dance: >-
    `ObservableQuery.refetch` and `ObservableQuery.reobserve` and the `execute`
    function of `useLazyQuery` now return a

    `ResultPromise` with an additional `.retain` method.

    If this method is called, the underlying network operation will be kept
    running even if the `ObservableQuery` itself does

    not require the result anymore, and the Promise will resolve with the final
    result instead of resolving with an intermediate

    result in the case of early cancellation.
  twenty-snakes-sort: >-
    `useLazyQuery` will now only execute the query when the execute function is
    called. Previously `useLazyQuery` would behave like `useQuery` after the
    first call to the execute function which means changes to options might
    perform network requests.


    You can now safely rerender `useLazyQuery` with new options which will take
    effect the next time you manually trigger the query.

    `ssrMode`, `ssrForceFetchDelay` and `disableNetworkFetches` have been

    Previously, a `ObservableQuery` created by `client.query` or
    `client.watchQuery`

    while one of those were active would permanently be changed from a
    `fetchPolicy`

    of `"network-only"` or `"cache-and-network"` to `"cache-first"`, and stay
    that way

    even long after `disableNetworkFetches` would have been deactivated.


    Now, the `ObservableQuery` will keep their original `fetchPolicy`, but
    queries

    made during `disableNetworkFetches` will just apply the `fetchPolicy`
    replacement

    at request time, just for that one request.


    `ApolloClient.disableNetworkFetches` has been renamed to
    `ApolloClient.prioritizeCacheValues` to better reflect this behaviour.

    than `ssr: false` while `ssr: false` had a higher priority than
    `fetchPolicy: "standby"` (which is roughly equivalent to `skip`).


    This priority has been adjusted so now both `skip` and `fetchPolicy:

    `loading: false`, while `ssr: false` will only come after those and will
    return `loading: true` if those are not set.

    Apollo Client now defaults to production mode, not development mode, if the

    environment cannot be determined.


    In modern bundlers, this should automatically be handled by the bundler
    loading

    the bundler with the `development` export condition.


    If neither the `production` nor the `development` export condition are

    used by the bundler/runtime, Apollo Client will fall back to
    `globalThis.__DEV__`

    to determine if it should run in production or development mode.


    Unlike Apollo Client 3 though, if `globalThis.__DEV__` is not set to `true`,

    Apollo Client will now default to `production`, not to `development`,
    behaviour.


    This switch to *explicilty* requiring `true` also resolves a situation where

    an HTML element with `id="__DEV__"` would create a global `__DEV__` variable

    with a referent to the DOM element, which in the past was picked up as
    "truthy" and

    would have triggered development mode.

    that your mocked responses include a `__typename` field. This will ensure
    cache normalization kicks in and behaves more like production.

  good-dolphins-peel: >-
    Apollo Client no longer wraps errors in `ApolloError`. `ApolloError` has
    been replaced with separate error classes depending on the cause of the
    error. As such, APIs that return an `error` property have been updated to
    use the generic `Error` type. Use `instanceof` to check for more specific
    error types.


    ## Migration guide


    `ApolloError` encapsulated 4 main error properties. The type of error would
    determine which property was set:

    - `graphqlErrors` - Errors returned from the `errors` field by the GraphQL
    server

    - `networkError` - Any non-GraphQL error that caused the query to fail

    - `protocolErrors` - Transport-level errors that occur during [multipart
    HTTP
    subscriptions](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/graphos/routing/operations/subscriptions/multipart-protocol)

    - `clientErrors` - A space to define custom errors. Mostly unused.


    These errors were mutally exclusive, meaning both `networkError` and
    `graphqlErrors` were never set simultaneously. The following replaces each
    of these fields from `ApolloError`.


    ### `graphqlErrors`


    GraphQL errors are now encapsulated in a `CombinedGraphQLErrors` instance.
    You can access the raw GraphQL errors via the `errors` property.


    ```js

    import { CombinedGraphQLErrors } from '@apollo/client';


    // ...


    const { error } = useQuery(query);


    if (error && error instanceof CombinedGraphQLErrors) {
      console.log(error.errors);
    }

    ```


    ### `networkError`


    Network errors are no longer wrapped and are instead passed through
    directly.


    ```js

    const client = new ApolloClient({
      link: new ApolloLink(() => {
        return new Observable((observer) => {
          observer.error(new Error('Test error'));
        })
      })
    })


    // ...


    const { error } = useQuery(query);


    // error is `new Error('Test error')`;

    ```


    ### `protocolErrors`


    Protocol errors are now encapsulated in a `CombinedProtocolErrors` instance.
    You can access the raw protocol errors via the `errors` property.



    ```js

    import { CombinedProtocolErrors } from '@apollo/client';


    // ...


    const { error } = useSubscription(subscription);


    if (error && error instanceof CombinedProtocolErrors) {
      console.log(error.errors);
    }

    ```


    ### `clientErrors`


    These were unused by the client and have no replacement. Any non-GraphQL or
    non-protocol errors are now passed through unwrapped.


    ### Strings as errors


    If the link sends a string error, Apollo Client will wrap this in an `Error`
    instance. This ensures `error` properties are guaranteed to be of type
    `Error`.


    ```js

    const client = new ApolloClient({
      link: new ApolloLink(() => {
        return new Observable((observer) => {
          // Oops we sent a string instead of wrapping it in an `Error`
          observer.error('Test error');
        })
      })
    })


    // ...


    const { error } = useQuery(query);


    // The error string is wrapped and returned as `new Error('Test error')`;

    ```


    ### Non-error types


    If the link chain sends any other object type as an error, Apollo Client
    will wrap this in an `UnknownError` instance with the
    [`cause`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Error/cause)
    set to the original object. This ensures `error` properties are guaranteed
    to be of type `Error`.


    ```js

    const client = new ApolloClient({
      link: new ApolloLink(() => {
        return new Observable((observer) => {
          observer.error({ message: 'Not a proper error type' });
        })
      })
    })


    // ...


    const { error } = useQuery(query);


    // error is an `UnknownError` instance. error.cause returns the original
    object.

    ```
  gorgeous-chefs-tap: >-
    Remove the `TCacheShape` generic argument to `ApolloClient`.
    `client.extract()` now returns `unknown` by default. You will either need to
    type-cast this to the expected serialized shape, or use the
    `cache.extract()` directly from the subclass to get more specific types.
  healthy-apes-sneeze: >-
    Remove `fromError` utility function. Use
    [`throwError`](https://rxjs.dev/api/index/function/throwError) instead.
  hot-cycles-notice: >-

  itchy-drinks-refuse: Remove `itAsync` test utility.
  khaki-spies-work: >-
    Flatten out React hook types. As a result, the base types have been removed.
    Prefer using the hook types instead. Removed types include:

    - `BaseQueryOptions`

    - `BaseSubscriptionOptions`

    - `ObservableQueryFields`

    - `MutationSharedOptions`

    - `QueryFunctionOptions`
  kind-crews-warn: >-
    `ObservableQuery` no longer has a `queryId` property.

    `ApolloClient.getObservableQueries` no longer returns a `Map<string,
    ObservableQuery>`, but a `Set<ObservableQuery>`.
  late-trainers-peel: >-
    * dropped the deprecated `DEV` export from `@apollo/client/utilities` and

    * moved the `invariant`, `newInvariantError` and `InvariantError` exports
    from `@apollo/client/utilities/globals` to
    `@apollo/client/utilities/invariant`
  light-apes-rescue: >-
    `useQuery` no longer returns `reobserve` as part of its result. It was
    possible to use `reobserve` to set new options on the underlying
    `ObservableQuery` instance which differed from the options passed to the
    hook. This could result in unexpected results. Instead prefer to rerender
    the hook with new options.
  little-parrots-bow: >-
    Removes the `resolvers` option from `ApolloClient`. Local resolvers have
    instead been moved to the new `LocalState` instance which is assigned to the
    `localState` option in `ApolloClient`. To migrate, move the `resolvers`
    values into a `LocalState` instance and assign that instance to
    `localState`.


    ```diff

    new ApolloClient({

    - resolvers: { /* ... */ }

    + localState: new LocalState({

    +   resolvers: { /* ... */ }

    + }),

    });

    ```
  little-spoons-kick: >-
    `client.mutate` now returns a `MutateResult` instead of `FetchResult`. As a
    result, the `errors` property has been removed in favor of `error` which is
    set if either a network error occured or GraphQL errors are returned from
    the server.


    `useMutation` now also returns a `MutateResult` instead of a `FetchResult`.
  lucky-hats-push: >-
    The execute function returned from `useLazyQuery` now only supports the
    `context` and `variables` options. This means that passing options supported
    by the hook no longer override the hook value.


    To change options, rerender the component with new options. These options
    will take effect with the next query execution.
  mighty-penguins-wink: >-
    Removes the `throwServerError` utility function. Now that `ServerError` is
    an

    `Error` subclass, you can throw these errors directly:


    ```js

    import { ServerError } from '@apollo/client';


    // instead of

    throwServerError(response, result, 'error message')


    // Use

    throw new ServerError('error message', { response, result })

    ```
  modern-feet-do: >-
    `@apollo/client`, `@apollo/client/core` and `@apollo/client/cache` no longer
    export an empty `Cache` runtime object. This is meant to be a type-only

  nervous-goats-allow: >-
    Removes the `defaultOptions` option from `useQuery`. Use options directly or

    that doesn't need caching.
  olive-cougars-ring: >-
    Remove local resolvers APIs from `ApolloClient` in favor of `localState`.
    Methods removed are:

    - `addResolvers`

    - `getResolvers`

    - `setResolvers`

    - `setLocalStateFragmentMatcher`
  purple-bears-flash: >-
    Removed the `@apollo/client/react/parser` entry point. There is no
    replacement.
  rich-eagles-cross: >-
    The `reobserve` option is no longer available in the result returned from
    `useLazyQuery`. This was considered an internal API and should not be used
    directly.
  selfish-spoons-approve: >-
    Move internal testing utilities in `@apollo/client/testing` to
    `@apollo/client/testing/internal` and remove deprecated testing utilities.
    Some of the testing utilities exported from the `@apollo/client/testing`
    endpoint were not considered stable. As a result of this change, testing
    utilities or types exported from `@apollo/client/testing` are now considered
    stable and will not undergo breaking changes.


    The following APIs were removed. To migrate, update usages of the following
    APIs as such:


    **`createMockClient`**


    ```diff

    - const client = createMockClient(data, query, variables);

    + const client = new ApolloClient({

    +   cache: new InMemoryCache(),

    +   link: new MockLink([

    +     {

    +       request: { query, variables },

    +       result: { data },

    +     }

    +   ]),

    + });

    ```


    **`mockObservableLink`**


    ```diff

    - const link = mockObservableLink();

    + const link = new MockSubscriptionLink();

    ```


    **`mockSingleLink`**


    ```diff

    - const link = mockSingleLink({

    -   request: { query, variables },

    -   result: { data },

    - });

    + const link = new MockLink([

    +   {

    +     request: { query, variables },

    +     result: { data },

    +   }

    + ]);

    ```
  serious-moons-juggle: >-
    `client.query` no longer supports `notifyOnNetworkStatusChange` in options.
    An error will be thrown if this option is set. The effects of this option
    were not observable by `client.query` since `client.query` emits a single
    result.
  shiny-carrots-invent: Remove `subscribeAndCount` testing utility from `@apollo/client/testing`.
  short-jokes-jam: >-
    Moves all React-related exports to the `@apollo/client/react` entrypoint and
    out of the main `@apollo/client` entrypoint. This prevents the need to
    install React in order to use the core client.


    The following is a list of exports available in `@apollo/client` that should
    now import from `@apollo/client/react`.

    - `ApolloConsumer`

    - `ApolloProvider`

    - `createQueryPreloader`

    - `getApolloContext`

    - `skipToken`

    - `useApolloClient`

    - `useBackgroundQuery`

    - `useReactiveVar`

    - `useReadQuery`

    - `useSubscription`

    - `useSuspenseQuery`


    The following is a list of exports available in `@apollo/client/testing`
    that should now import from `@apollo/client/testing/react`:

    - `MockedProvider`
  silly-knives-exist: >-
    Removes the `urql` multipart subscriptions utilities. Use the native
    multipart subscriptions support in `urql` instead.
  silly-seas-confess: Drop `graphql` v15 as a valid peer dependency.
  six-jars-fix: >-
    `queryRef`s created by `preloadQuery` no longer have a `.toPromise()`
    function. Instead `preloadQuery` now has a `toPromise` function that accepts
    a queryRef and will resolve when the underlying promise has been resolved.


    ```diff

    const queryRef = preloadQuery(query, options);


    - await queryRef.toPromise();

    + await preloadQuery.toPromise(queryRef);

    ```
  sixty-bears-bathe: >-
    The `FetchMoreQueryOptions` type has been inlined into `FetchMoreOptions`,
    and

    `FetchMoreQueryOptions` has been removed.
  slimy-chicken-melt: >-
    Remove deprecated `onSubscriptionData` and `onSubscriptionComplete`
    callbacks from `useSubscription`. Use `onData` and `onComplete` instead.
  small-buttons-rhyme: >-
    Remove the deprecated `canonizeResults` option. It was prone to memory
    leaks. As such, some results that were referentially equal when
    `canonizeResults` option was set to `true` no longer retain the same object
    identity.
  smart-rats-explode: >-
    Remove `ObservableQuery.resetQueryStoreErrors` method. This method reset
    some internal state that was not consumed elsewhere in the client and
    resulted in a no-op.
  smooth-coins-collect: >-
    Remove `fromPromise` utility function. Use
    [`from`](https://rxjs.dev/api/index/function/from) instead.
  sour-pillows-guess: >-
    The `defaultOptions` and `initialFetchPolicy` options are no longer
    supported with `useLazyQuery`.


    If you use `defaultOptions`, pass those options directly to the hook
    instead. If you use `initialFetchPolicy`, use `fetchPolicy` instead.
  stupid-pumpkins-travel: >-
    Apollo Client no longer ships with support for `@client` fields
    out-of-the-box and now must be opt-in. To opt in to use `@client` fields,
    pass an instantiated `LocalState` instance to the `localState` option. If a
    query contains `@client` and local state hasn't been configured, an error
    will be thrown.


    ```ts

    import { LocalState } from "@apollo/client/local-state";


    new ApolloClient({
      localState: new LocalState(),
    });

    ```
  tall-bikes-develop: >-
    Remove `resetResultIdentities` option from `InMemoryCache.gc()`. This
    affected object canonization which has been removed.
  tender-swans-flash: >-
    Remove `loading`, `networkStatus`, and `partial` properties on all
    promise-based query APIs. These properties were mostly static and were
    unnecessary since promise resolution guaranteed that the query was not
    longer loading.


    This affects the following APIs:

    - `client.query`

    - `client.refetchQueries`

    - `client.reFetchObservableQueries`

    - `client.resetStore`

    - `observableQuery.fetchMore`

    - `observableQuery.refetch`

    - `observableQuery.reobserve`

    - `observableQuery.setVariables`

    - The `useLazyQuery` `execute` function
  tidy-squids-poke: >-
    Removes `ObservableQuery.result()` method. If you use this method and need
    similar functionality, use the `firstValueFrom` helper in RxJS.


    ```ts

    import { firstValueFrom, from } from "rxjs";


    // The `from` is necessary to turn `observableQuery` into an RxJS observable

    const result = await firstValueFrom(from(observableQuery))

    ```

    instead.
  wicked-forks-double: >-
    Remove `newData` option for mocked responses passed to `MockLink` or the
    `mocks` option on `MockedProvider`. This option was undocumented and was
    nearly identical to using the `result` option as a callback.


    To replicate the old behavior of `newData`, use `result` as a callback and
    add the `maxUsageCount` option with a value set to
    `Number.POSITIVE_INFINITY`.


    **with `MockLink`**

    ```diff

    new MockLink([
      {
        request: { query, variables },
    -   newData: (variables) => ({ data: { greeting: "Hello " +
    variables.greeting } }),

    +   result: (variables) => ({ data: { greeting: "Hello " +
    variables.greeting } }),

    +   maxUsageCount: Number.POSITIVE_INFINITY,
      }
    ])

    ```


    **with `MockedProvider`**

    ```diff

    <MockedProvider
      mocks={[
        {
          request: { query, variables },

  witty-paws-marry: >-
    Require the `link` option when instantiating `ApolloClient`. This removes

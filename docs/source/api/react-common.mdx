import ApolloProvider from '../../shared/apollo-provider.mdx';

## Installation

```
npm install @apollo/react-common
```

## `ApolloProvider`

<ApolloProvider />

## `ApolloConsumer`

One way to access the configured Apollo Client instance directly is to create an `ApolloConsumer` component and provide a render prop function as its child. The render prop function will be called with your `ApolloClient` instance as its only argument. You can think of the `ApolloConsumer` component as similar to the `Consumer` component from the [React Context API](https://reactjs.org/docs/context.html).

### Example

```jsx
import React from 'react';
import { ApolloConsumer } from '@apollo/react-common';
// or from the hooks, components, hoc packages:
// import { ApolloConsumer } from "@apollo/react-hooks";

const WithApolloClient = () => (
  <ApolloConsumer>
    {client => 'We have access to the client!' /* do stuff here */}
  </ApolloConsumer>
);
```

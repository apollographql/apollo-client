{/* * @import {MDXProvidedComponents} from '../../../shared/MdxProvidedComponents.js' */}

Represents a fatal error when executing `@client` fields from `LocalState`, typically to indicate a problem with the `LocalState` configuration or incorrect usage of a resolver function. This error does not represent user errors thrown in a local resolver when resolving `@client` fields.

```ts
import { LocalStateError } from "@apollo/client/errors";

// Check if an error is a LocalStateError instance
if (LocalStateError.is(error)) {
  console.log('Original error:', error.cause);

  // Determine which field caused the error
  if (error.path) {
    console.log('Error occurred at field path:', error.path.join("."));
  }
}
```

## Static methods

### `is`

A type guard that determines whether an error is a `LocalStateError` object. This method provides reliable type checking and enables TypeScript to narrow the error type.

```ts
if (LocalStateError.is(error)) {
  // TypeScript now knows `error` is a LocalStateError object
  console.log(error.errors);
}
```

See the [additional properties](#additional-properties) for more details about the available properties provided by the `LocalStateError` object.

## Additional properties

These properties are specific to the `LocalStateError` object. Standard error [instance properties](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Error#instance_properties) are also available.

<Tip>
  Use the `cause` property to determine the original cause of the `LocalStateError` error when the error is thrown as a result of a downstream error.

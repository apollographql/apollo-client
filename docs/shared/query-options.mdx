| Option | Type | Description |
| - | - | - |
| `query` | DocumentNode | A GraphQL query document parsed into an AST by `graphql-tag`. **Optional** for the `useQuery` Hook since the query can be passed in as the first parameter to the Hook. **Required** for the `Query` component. |
| `variables` | { [key: string]: any } | An object containing all of the variables your query needs to execute |
| `pollInterval` | number | Specifies the interval in ms at which you want your component to poll for data. Defaults to 0 (no polling). |
| `notifyOnNetworkStatusChange` | boolean | Whether updates to the network status or network error should re-render your component. Defaults to false. |
| `fetchPolicy` | FetchPolicy | How you want your component to interact with the Apollo cache. For details, see [Setting a fetch policy](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/react/data/queries/#setting-a-fetch-policy). |
| `nextFetchPolicy` | FetchPolicy | Optional `FetchPolicy` to begin enforcing after the current request. Useful for switching back to `cache-first` after `cache-and-network` or `network-only`. |
| `errorPolicy` | ErrorPolicy | How you want your component to handle network and GraphQL errors. Defaults to "none", which means we treat GraphQL errors as runtime errors. |
| `ssr` | boolean | Pass in false to skip your query during server-side rendering. |
| `displayName` | string | The name of your component to be displayed in React DevTools. Defaults to 'Query'. |
| `skip` | boolean | If skip is true, the query will be skipped entirely. **Not available with `useLazyQuery`**. |
| `onCompleted` | (data: TData &#124; {}) => void | A callback executed once your query successfully completes. |
| `onError` | (error: ApolloError) => void | A callback executed in the event of an error. |
| `context` | Record&lt;string, any&gt; | Shared context between your component and your network interface (Apollo Link). |
| `partialRefetch` | boolean | If `true`, perform a query `refetch` if the query result is marked as being partial, and the returned data is reset to an empty Object by the Apollo Client `QueryManager` (due to a cache miss). The default value is `false` for backwards-compatibility's sake, but should be changed to true for most use-cases. |
| `client` | ApolloClient | An `ApolloClient` instance. By default `useQuery` / `Query` uses the client passed down via context, but a different client can be passed in. |
| `returnPartialData` | boolean | Opt into receiving partial results from the cache for queries that are not fully satisfied by the cache. false by default. |

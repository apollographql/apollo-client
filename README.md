The Apollo Client can easily be dropped into any JavaScript frontend where you want to use data from a GraphQL server.

It's simple to use, and very small (less than 33kb), while having a lot of useful features around caching, polling, and refetching.

## Installing

```txt
npm install apollo-client
```

To use this client in a web browser or mobile app, you'll need a build system capable of loading NPM packages on the client. Some common choices include Browserify, Webpack, and Meteor 1.3. Move on to the next article to see how to import and initialize the client.

Running tests locally:

```
# nvm use node
npm install
npm test
```

This project uses TypeScript for static typing and TSLint for linting. You can get both of these built into your editor with no configuration by opening this project in [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/), an open source IDE which is available for free on all platforms.

#### Useful tools

Should be moved into some kind of CONTRIBUTING.md soon...

- [AST explorer](https://astexplorer.net/): you can use this to see what the GraphQL query AST looks like for different queries

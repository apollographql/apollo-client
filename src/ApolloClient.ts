   *
   * @param cache The initial cache to use in the data store.
   *
   * @param ssrMode Determines whether this is being run in Server Side Rendering (SSR) mode.
   *
   * @param ssrForceFetchDelay Determines the time interval before we force fetch queries for a
   * server side render.
   *
   * @param queryDeduplication If set to false, a query will still be sent to the server even if a query
   * with identical parameters (query, variables, operationName) is already in flight.
   *
   * @param defaultOptions Used to set application wide defaults for the
   *                       options supplied to `watchQuery`, `query`, or
   *                       `mutate`.

   *                               which enables substantial performance optimizations. Passing

   * @param name A custom name that can be used to identify this client, when
   *             using Apollo client awareness features. E.g. "iOS".
   *
   * @param version A custom version that can be used to identify this client,

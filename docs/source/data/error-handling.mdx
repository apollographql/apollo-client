title: Handling operation errors

{/* * @import {MDXProvidedComponents} from '../../../shared/MdxProvidedComponents.js' */}

Apollo Client can encounter a variety of errors when executing operations on your GraphQL server. Apollo Client helps you handle these errors according to their type, enabling you to show appropriate information to the user when an error occurs.

## Error types

Executing GraphQL operations on a remote server can result in [GraphQL errors](#graphql-errors) or [network errors](#network-errors).

### GraphQL errors

These are errors related to the server-side execution of a GraphQL operation. They include:

- **Syntax errors** (e.g., a query was malformed)
- **Validation errors** (e.g., a query included a schema field that doesn't exist)
- **Resolver errors** (e.g., an error occurred while attempting to populate a query field)

If a syntax error or validation error occurs, your server doesn't execute the operation at all because it's invalid. If resolver errors occur, your server can still return [partial data](#partial-data-with-resolver-errors).

> Learn more about GraphQL errors in the [Apollo Server documentation](/apollo-server/data/errors/).

If a GraphQL error occurs, your server includes it in the `errors` array of its response to Apollo Client:

<ExpansionPanel title="Example error response">

```json
{
  "errors": [
    {
      "message": "Cannot query field \"nonexistentField\" on type \"Query\".",
      "locations": [
        {
          "line": 2,
          "column": 3
        }
      ],
      "extensions": {
        "code": "GRAPHQL_VALIDATION_FAILED",
        "exception": {
          "stacktrace": [
            "GraphQLError: Cannot query field \"nonexistentField\" on type \"Query\".",
            "...additional lines..."
          ]
        }
      }
    }
  ],
  "data": null
}
```

</ExpansionPanel>

Apollo Client then adds those errors to the `error` field returned by the `useQuery` hook (or whichever operation hook you used), wrapped as a [`CombinedGraphQLErrors`](../api/errors/CombinedGraphQLErrors) error instance.

<Note>
  If a GraphQL error prevents your server from executing your operation at all,
  your server may respond with a non-`2xx` status code. Apollo Client handles
  this according to the [GraphQL Over HTTP
  specification](https://graphql.github.io/graphql-over-http/draft/).
</Note>

#### Partial data with resolver errors

An operation that produces resolver errors might _also_ return partial data. This means that some (but not all) of the data your operation requested is included in your server's response. Apollo Client _ignores_ partial data by default to avoid caching `null` values due to errors, but you can override this behavior by [setting a GraphQL error policy](#graphql-error-policies).

### Network errors

These are errors encountered while attempting to communicate with your GraphQL server. The error may be a result of a `4xx` or `5xx` response status code, a failure to communicate with the server (such is when the network is unavailable), or a custom error thrown in an [Apollo Link request handler](../api/link/introduction#the-request-handler).

When a network error occurs, Apollo Client adds it to the `error` field returned by the `useQuery` hook (or whichever operation hook you used) as the error that was returned by the link chain (typically an `Error` instance).

You can add retry logic and other advanced network error handling to your application with [Apollo Link](#advanced-error-handling-with-apollo-link).

## Error classes

Apollo Client provides a comprehensive set of error classes to help you identify and handle different types of errors that can occur during the lifecycle of a GraphQL application. These error classes help narrow down whether the error was a result of [GraphQL errors](#graphql-errors) or a [network error](#network-errors). All error classes extend the standard JavaScript `Error` class and provide additional context specific to their error type.

These error classes are designed to give you precise information about what went wrong, whether it's a server-side GraphQL error, a network connectivity issue, or some other reason for the error.

Learn more about individual error classes from [additional resources](#additional-resources).

### Determing the error type with the `is` method

Every error class provides a static `is` method that reliably determines whether an error is of that specific type. This method provides a more robust alternative to `instanceof` because it avoids false positives and negatives, such as errors constructed in another realm (see [`Error.isError`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Error/isError) for more information.)

```ts
import {
  CombinedGraphQLErrors,
  CombinedProtocolErrors,
  LocalStateError,
  ServerError,
  ServerParseError,
  UnconventionalError,
} from "@apollo/client/errors";

// In your error handling logic
function handleError(error: unknown) {
  if (CombinedGraphQLErrors.is(error)) {
    // Handle GraphQL errors
  } else if (CombinedProtocolErrors.is(error)) {
    // Handle multipart subscription protocol errors
  } else if (LocalStateError.is(error)) {
    // Handle errors thrown by the `LocalState` class
  } else if (ServerError.is(error)) {
    // Handle server HTTP errors
  } else if (ServerParseError.is(error)) {
    // Handle parse errors
  } else if (UnconventionalError.is(error)) {
    // Handle errors thrown by irregular types
  } else {
    // Handle other errors
  }
}
```

## GraphQL error policies

If a GraphQL operation produces one or more [GraphQL errors](#graphql-errors), your server's response might still include partial data in the `data` field:

```json
{
  "data": {
    "getInt": 12,
    "getString": null
  },
  "errors": [
    {
      "message": "Failed to get string!"
      // ...additional fields...
    }
  ]
}
```

By default, Apollo Client throws away partial data and populates the `error` field of the `useQuery` hook (or whichever hook you're using). You can instead _use_ these partial results by defining an **error policy** for your operation.

Apollo Client supports the following error policies:

| Policy   | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| -------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `none`   | If the response includes errors, they are returned in the `error` field and the response `data` is set to `undefined` even if the server returns `data` in its response. This means network errors and GraphQL errors result in a similar response shape. This is the default error policy. |
| `ignore` | Errors are ignored (`error` is _not_ populated), and any returned `data` is cached and rendered as if no errors occurred. Note: `data` may also be `undefined` in the event a network error occurs.                                                                                         |
| `all`    | Both `data` and `error` are populated and any returned `data` is cached, enabling you to render both partial results and error information.                                                                                                                                                 |

### Setting an error policy

Specify an error policy in the options object you provide your operation hook (such as `useQuery`), like so:

```jsx {9}
const MY_QUERY = gql`
  query WillFail {
    badField # This field's resolver produces an error
    goodField # This field is populated successfully
  }
`;

function ShowingSomeErrors() {
  const { loading, error, data } = useQuery(MY_QUERY, { errorPolicy: "all" });

  if (loading) return <span>loading...</span>;

  return (
    <div>
      <h2>Good: {data?.goodField}</h2>
      <pre>Bad: {error && <span>{error.message}</span>}</pre>
    </div>
  );
}
```

This example uses the `all` error policy to render both partial data and error information whenever applicable.

### Consuming errors based on the error policy

Errors are consumed in different ways, depending on whether you're using a promise-based API, an observable-based API, or a React hook. The behavior varies based on the [error policy](#graphql-error-policies) you've configured.

#### Promise-based APIs

Promises returned by promise-based APIs, like `client.query` and `client.mutate`, handle errors differently depending on the error policy:

##### `errorPolicy: "none"`

The promise rejects when an error occurs. Use try-catch or the `.catch` method to handle errors.

```ts
import { CombinedGraphQLErrors } from "@apollo/client/errors";

try {
  const result = await client.query({
    query: MY_QUERY,
    errorPolicy: "none", // default
  });
  console.log(result.data);
} catch (error) {
  if (CombinedGraphQLErrors.is(error)) {
    console.log("GraphQL errors:", error.errors);
  }
  // Network errors and other errors also reject the promise
}
```

##### `errorPolicy: "all"`

The promise resolves even when an error occurs, with the error available on the `error` property of the result.

```ts
import { CombinedGraphQLErrors } from "@apollo/client/errors";

// With errorPolicy: "all" - returns both data and errors
const result = await client.query({
  query: MY_QUERY,
  errorPolicy: "all",
});

if (result.error && CombinedGraphQLErrors.is(result.error)) {
  console.log("GraphQL errors:", result.error.errors);
  console.log("Partial data:", result.data); // May contain partial data
}
```

##### `errorPolicy: "ignore"`

The promise resolves and the error is discarded. The `error` property is not set.

```ts
import { CombinedGraphQLErrors } from "@apollo/client/errors";

// With errorPolicy: "ignore" - returns data but ignores errors
const result = await client.query({
  query: MY_QUERY,
  errorPolicy: "ignore",
});

// result.error will be undefined even if an error occurs
console.log("Data (errors ignored):", result.data);
```

#### Observable-based APIs

Observable-based APIs, like `client.watchQuery`, handle errors differently depending on the error policy:

##### `errorPolicy: "none"`

The error is emitted in the observer's `error` callback when an error occurs.

```ts
import { CombinedGraphQLErrors } from "@apollo/client/errors";

const observable = client.watchQuery({
  query: MY_QUERY,
  errorPolicy: "none", // default
});

observable.subscribe({
  next(result) {
    console.log("Result:", result.data);
  },
  error(error) {
    if (CombinedGraphQLErrors.is(error)) {
      console.log(`Got ${error.errors.length} GraphQL errors`);
    }
  },
});
```

##### `errorPolicy: "all"`

The error is added to the `error` property in the result emitted in the observer's `next` callback.

```ts
const observable = client.watchQuery({
  query: MY_QUERY,
  errorPolicy: "all",
});

observable.subscribe({
  next(result) {
    if (result.error) {
      console.log("Got error:", result.error.message);
    } else {
      console.log("Result:", result.data);
    }
  },
});
```

##### `errorPolicy: "ignore"`

The result is emitted in the observer's `next` callback and the error is discarded. The `error` property is not set.

```ts
const observable = client.watchQuery({
  query: MY_QUERY,
  errorPolicy: "ignore",
});

observable.subscribe({
  next(result) {
    console.log("Result:", result.data);
  },
});
```

#### React hooks

React hooks provide errors via the `error` property. `data` and `error` is set according to the query's `errorPolicy`.

```ts
import { useQuery, useMutation } from "@apollo/client";
import { CombinedGraphQLErrors } from "@apollo/client/errors";

function MyComponent() {
  const { data, loading, error } = useQuery(MY_QUERY);

  if (error) {
    if (CombinedGraphQLErrors.is(error)) {
      return <div>Query failed: {error.errors[0].message}</div>;
    }

    return <div>Network error: {error.message}</div>;
  }

  return <div>{/* render data */}</div>;
}
```

<Note>
  Suspense hooks might throw errors to React error boundaries depending on the configured `errorPolicy`. Learn more about error handling with Suspense hooks in the [Suspense documentation](./suspense#error-handling).
</Note>


## Advanced error handling with Apollo Link

The [Apollo Link](../api/link/introduction/) class enables you to configure advanced handling of errors that occur while executing GraphQL operations.

As a recommended first step, you can add an [`ErrorLink`](../api/link/apollo-link-error/) to your [link chain](../api/link/introduction/#handling-a-response) that receives error details and acts on them.

The following example provides a link chain to the `ApolloClient` constructor with two links:

- An `ErrorLink` that receives error details through the error handler callback. It logs the details of errors it finds.
- An `HttpLink` that sends each GraphQL operation to your server (this is the chain's [terminating link](../api/link/introduction/#the-terminating-link).)

<ExpansionPanel title="Click to expand example">

```jsx
import {
  ApolloClient,
  HttpLink,
  InMemoryCache,
  CombinedGraphQLErrors,
  from,
} from "@apollo/client";
import { ErrorLink } from "@apollo/client/link/error";

const errorLink = new ErrorLink(({ error }) => {
  if (CombinedGraphQLErrors.is(error)) {
    error.errors.forEach(({ message, locations, path }) =>
      console.log(
        `[GraphQL error]: Message: ${message}, Location: ${locations}, Path: ${path}`
      )
    );
  } else {
    console.error('[Network error]:', error);
  }
});

const httpLink = new HttpLink({ uri: "http://localhost:4000/graphql" });

const client = new ApolloClient({
  cache: new InMemoryCache(),
  link: from([errorLink, httpLink]),
});
```

</ExpansionPanel>

### Retrying operations

Apollo Link helps you retry failed operations that might be resolved by a followup attempt. We recommend different links depending on the type of error that occurred:

- The [`ErrorLink`](../api/link/apollo-link-error) for [GraphQL errors](#on-graphql-errors)
- The [`RetryLink`](../api/link/apollo-link-retry) for [network errors](#on-network-errors)

#### On GraphQL errors

The `ErrorLink` can retry a failed operation based on the type of GraphQL error that's returned. For example, when using token-based authentication, you might want to automatically handle re-authentication when the token expires.

To retry an operation, you `return forward(operation)` in your error handler function. Here's an example:

```js {15}
new ErrorLink(({ error, operation, forward }) => {
  if (CombinedGraphQLErrors.is(error)) {
    for (let err of error.errors) {
      switch (err.extensions.code) {
        // Apollo Server, for example, sets `code` to `"UNAUTHENTICATED"`
        // when an AuthenticationError is thrown in a resolver
        case "UNAUTHENTICATED": {
          // Modify the operation context with a new token
          const oldHeaders = operation.getContext().headers;
          operation.setContext({
            headers: {
              ...oldHeaders,
              authorization: getNewToken(),
            },
          });
          // Retry the request, returning the new observable
          return forward(operation);
        }
      }
    }
  }

  // Log the error for any unhandled GraphQL errors or network errors.
  console.log(`[Error]: ${error.message}`);
});
```

<Note>
  If your retried operation _also_ results in errors, those errors are _not_
  passed to `ErrorLink` to prevent an infinite loop of operations. This means
  that an `ErrorLink` can retry a particular operation only once.
</Note>

If you don't want to retry an operation, your `ErrorLink`'s error handler function should return nothing.

See the [`ErrorLink` API reference](../api/link/apollo-link-error/) for more details.

#### On network errors

To retry operations that encounter a network error, we recommend adding a `RetryLink` to your link chain. This link enables you to configure retry logic like exponential backoff and total number of attempts.

See the [`RetryLink` API reference](../api/link/apollo-link-retry/) for more details.

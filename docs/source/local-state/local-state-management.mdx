At its core, Apollo Client is a **state management** library that happens to use GraphQL to interact with a remote server. Naturally, some application state doesn't _require_ a remote server because it's entirely local.

Apollo Client enables you to manage local state alongside remotely fetched state, meaning you can interact with _all_ of your application's state with a single API.

## How it works

You can store local state in the same [normalized, in-memory cache](../caching/cache-configuration/) as the results of your remote GraphQL operations. You can query the cache for local data just like you query for remote data, as described in [Interacting with cached data](../caching/cache-interaction/). You can even fetch both types of data in a single query:

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant Apollo Client;
    participant Cache;
    participant GraphQL Server;

    Apollo Client->>Cache: Queries local and remote fields;
    Note over Cache: Calculates local fields;
    Cache->>GraphQL Server: Queries remote fields;
    Note over GraphQL Server: Resolves remote fields;
    GraphQL Server->>Cache: Returns remote fields;
    Note over Cache: Caches remote fields;
    Cache->>Apollo Client: Returns ALL fields;
    Note over Apollo Client: Time passesâ€¦;
    Apollo Client->>Cache: Executes same query;
    Note over Cache: Calculates local fields;
    Note over Cache: Fetches remote fields (now cached);
    Cache->>Apollo Client: Returns ALL fields;
```

Apollo Client 3 introduces two complementary mechanisms for managing local state: [field policies](#field-policies) and [reactive variables](#reactive-variables).

> The [local resolver API](./local-resolvers/) from previous versions of Apollo Client is also available but is [deprecated](./local-resolvers/#deprecation-notice).

## Field policies

> Available in Apollo Client >= 3.0

**Field policies** enable you to define what happens when you query a particular field, _including fields that aren't defined in your GraphQL server's schema_. In addition to specifying these local-only fields (with the `@client` directive), you can use field policies to transform _any_ field's value on its way into or out of your cache.

A single GraphQL query can include both schema fields and local-only fields. In the field policy for each local-only field, you specify a function that defines how that field's value is populated.

[Get started with field policies](./managing-state-with-field-policies/)

## Reactive variables

> Available in Apollo Client >= 3.0

**Reactive variables** enable you to read and write local data anywhere in your application, without needing to use a GraphQL operation to do so. The [field policy](#field-policies) of a local-only field can use a reactive variable to store the field's current value.

Reactive values _aren't_ stored in the Apollo Client cache, so they don't need to conform to the strict structure of a cached type. You can store anything you want in them.

Whenever the value of a reactive variable changes, Apollo Client broadcasts that change. Every active query with a field that depends on that variable's value automatically updates (hence "reactive").

[Get started with reactive variables](./reactive-variables)

## Local resolvers (deprecated)

> Available in Apollo Client >= 2.5

In earlier versions of Apollo Client, you define **local resolvers** to populate and modify local-only fields. These resolvers are similar in structure and purpose to the [resolvers that your GraphQL server defines](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/apollo-server/data/resolvers/).

This functionality is still available in Apollo Client 3, but it is deprecated.

## Why am I seeing this?

In Apollo Client 3.8 and later, we are shipping the error messages separately to save bundle size. You can still load them manually, but this is an opt-in mechanism.

### Opting in to error message inclusion

You can call the `loadErrorMessages` function from `"@apollo/client/dev"` to
load error messages. Similarly, you can use `loadDevMessages` to import development-time console messages.

### Limiting error message inclusion to development builds

In most environments, you can check for `__DEV__` to make sure that you are in a development environment. So your code to load the error messages conditionally could for example look like this:

```js
import { loadErrorMessages, loadDevMessages } from "@apollo/client/dev";
if (__DEV__) {
  loadErrorMessages();
  loadDevMessages();
}
```

Not all environments support `__DEV__`, so if that doesn't work, you maybe want to check for `process.env.NODE_ENV !== "production"` instead.

React Apollo allows you to fetch data from your GraphQL server and use it in building complex and reactive UIs using the React framework. React Apollo may be used in any context that React may be used. In the browser, in React Native, or in Node.js when you want to server side render.

React Apollo, unlike some other tools in the React ecosystem requires _no_ complex build setup to get up and running. As long as you have a GraphQL server you can get started building out your application with React immediately. React Apollo works out of the box with both [`create-react-app`](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app) and [React Native](http://facebook.github.io/react-native
) with a single install and with no extra hassle configuring Babel or other JavaScript tools.

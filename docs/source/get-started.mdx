description: Set up Apollo Client in your React app
---

Out of the box Apollo Client includes packages that we think are essential for building an Apollo app, like our in-memory cache, local state management, error handling, and a React based view layer.

> This tutorial walks you through installing and configuring Apollo Client
> for your React app. If you're just getting started with GraphQL or the Apollo
> platform, we recommend first completing the [full-stack tutorial](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/tutorial/introduction/).

## Installation

First, let's install the Apollo Client and GraphQL packages:

```bash
npm install @apollo/client graphql
```

- `@apollo/client`: Contains everything you need to set up Apollo Client
- `graphql`: Parses your GraphQL queries

> If you'd like to walk through this tutorial yourself, we recommend either running a new React project locally with [Create React App](https://create-react-app.dev/) or creating a new React sandbox on [CodeSandbox](https://codesandbox.io/). For reference, we will be using [this CodeSandbox](https://codesandbox.io/s/practical-snyder-48p1r2roz4) as our GraphQL server for our sample app, which pulls exchange rate data from the Coinbase API. If you'd like to skip ahead and see the app we're about to build, you can [view it on CodeSandbox](https://codesandbox.io/s/get-started-coinbase-client-73r10).

## Create a client

Great, now that you have all the dependencies you need, let's create your Apollo Client. The only thing you need to get started is the endpoint for your GraphQL server.

In our `index.js` file, let's import `ApolloClient` from `@apollo/client` and add the endpoint for our GraphQL server to the `uri` property of the client config object.

```js
import { ApolloClient, InMemoryCache } from '@apollo/client';

const client = new ApolloClient({
  uri: 'https://48p1r2roz4.sse.codesandbox.io',
  cache: new InMemoryCache()
});
```

That's it! Now your client is ready to start fetching data. Before we show how to use Apollo Client with React, let's try sending a query with plain JavaScript first. In the same `index.js` file, try calling `client.query()`. Remember to first import the `gql` function for parsing your query string into a query document.

```js
import { gql } from '@apollo/client';

...

client
  .query({
    query: gql`
      query GetRates {
        rates(currency: "USD") {
          currency
        }
      }
    `
  })
  .then(result => console.log(result));
```

Open up your console and inspect the result object. You should see a `data` property with `rates` attached, along with some other properties like `loading` and `networkStatus`. While you don't need React or another front-end framework just to fetch data with Apollo Client, our view layer integrations make it easier to bind your queries to your UI and reactively update your components with data. Let's learn how to use Apollo Client with React so we can start building query components.

## Connect your client to React

To connect Apollo Client to React, you will need to use the `ApolloProvider` component. The `ApolloProvider` is similar to React's [`Context.Provider`](https://reactjs.org/docs/context.html#contextprovider). It wraps your React app and places the client on the context, which allows you to access it from anywhere in your component tree.

In `index.js`, let's wrap our React app with an `ApolloProvider`. We suggest putting the `ApolloProvider` somewhere high in your app, above any places where you need to access GraphQL data. For example, it could be outside of your root route component if you're using React Router.

```jsx
import React from 'react';
import { render } from 'react-dom';

import { ApolloProvider } from '@apollo/client';

function App() {
  return (
    <ApolloProvider client={client}>
      <div>
        <h2>My first Apollo app 🚀</h2>
      </div>
    </ApolloProvider>
  );
}

render(<App />, document.getElementById('root'));
```

## Request data

Once your `ApolloProvider` is hooked up, you're ready to start requesting data with the `useQuery` hook! `useQuery` is a hook that leverages the [Hooks API](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-intro.html) to share GraphQL data with your UI.

First, pass your GraphQL query wrapped in the `gql` function into the `useQuery` hook. When your component renders and the `useQuery` hook runs, a result object will be returned containing `loading`, `error`, and `data` properties. Apollo Client tracks error and loading state for you, which will be reflected in the `loading` and `error` properties. Once the result of your query comes back, it will be attached to the `data` property.

Let's create an `ExchangeRates` component in `index.js` to see the `useQuery` hook in action!

```jsx
import { useQuery, gql } from '@apollo/client';

const EXCHANGE_RATES = gql`
  query GetExchangeRates {
    rates(currency: "USD") {
      currency
      rate
    }
  }
`;

function ExchangeRates() {
  const { loading, error, data } = useQuery(EXCHANGE_RATES);

  if (loading) return <p>Loading...</p>;
  if (error) return <p>Error :(</p>;

  return data.rates.map(({ currency, rate }) => (
    <div key={currency}>
      <p>
        {currency}: {rate}
      </p>
    </div>
  ));
}
```

Congrats, you just made your first `useQuery` based component! 🎉 If you render your `ExchangeRates` component within your `App` component from the previous example, you'll first see a loading indicator and then data on the page once it's ready. Apollo Client automatically caches this data when it comes back from the server, so you won't see a loading indicator if you run the same query twice.

If you'd like to play around with the app we just built, you can [view it on CodeSandbox](https://codesandbox.io/s/get-started-coinbase-client-73r10). Don't stop there! Try building more components that leverage `useQuery` and experimenting with the concepts you just learned.

## Next steps

Now that you've learned how to fetch data with Apollo Client, you're ready to dive deeper into creating more complex queries and mutations. After this section, we recommend moving onto:

- [Queries](data/queries/): Learn how to fetch queries with arguments and dive deeper into configuration options. For a full list of options, check out the API reference for `useQuery`.
- [Mutations](data/mutations/): Learn how to update data with mutations and when you'll need to update the Apollo cache. For a full list of options, check out the API reference for `useMutation` components.
- [Apollo Client API](api/core/ApolloClient/): Sometimes, you'll need to access the client directly like we did in our plain JavaScript example above. Visit the API reference for a full list of options.

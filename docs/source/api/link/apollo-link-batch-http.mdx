## Context

The batch HTTP link currently uses the context in two different ways, per batch and per query. The context fields below are used per batch and taken from the first operation in the batch.

| Option         | Description                                                              |
| -------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `headers`      | An object representing values to be sent as headers on the request       |
| `credentials`  | A string representing the credentials policy you want for the fetch call |
| `uri`          | A string of the endpoint you want to fetch from                          |
| `fetchOptions` | Any overrides of the fetch options argument to pass to the fetch call    |
| `response`     | This is the raw response from the fetch request after it is made         |

For each query, the `http` field is used to modify each individual query in the batch, such as persisted queries (see below).

## Custom fetching

See [Customizing `fetch`](apollo-link-http/#customizing-fetch).

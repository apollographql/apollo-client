## What is this page?

Beginning with version 3.8, Apollo Client _omits_ error messages from its core bundle to reduce its bundle size. Instead, errors direct you to this page to view details.

**If you prefer, you can add Apollo Client error messages to your app:**

```js title="App.js"
import { loadErrorMessages, loadDevMessages } from "@apollo/client/dev";

if (__DEV__) {  // Adds messages only in a dev environment
  loadDevMessages();
  loadErrorMessages();
}
```

- `loadDevMessages()` loads messages for errors that are raised _only in a development environment_.
- `loadErrorMessages()` loads messages for errors that are raised in _all_ environments.

You can call either or both of these methods on application load.

<blockquote>

**Note:** The example above checks for the presence of the `__DEV__` variable and loads error messages only if it's present (indicating a dev environment). This can provide a helpful development experience while minimizing your bundle size in production.

The `__DEV__` variable isn't available in all environments. As an alternative, you can check whether `process.env.NODE_ENV !== "production"`.
